On November 15, 2012, Xi Jinping stood before thousands of members of the Communist Party of China in his first public speech as the leader of the unfree world. He vowed to fulfill one ultimate goal: the “great revival of the Chinese nation.” During the 11 years between the day Xi gave that speech and the day he attended the US-China Business Council Dinner in San Francisco on November 15th, 2024, Xi’s repressive, hardline policies have changed China beyond recognition, for the worse.

Under Xi’s reign of terror, in Hong Kong, the National Security Law has eradicated any remaining semblance of democracy, arresting thousands of bright student leaders, brave youth activists, opposition politicians, and journalists. As of May 31, 2024, the Hong Kong Democracy Council’s database has documented 1,866 political prisoners in Hong Kong. In occupied Tibet, a vast system of colonial boarding schools has separated over 80% of Tibetan students from their parents. Along with other extreme attacks on Tibetan identity, these policies threaten the very continuation of Tibet’s language, culture, and way of life.

But the CCP has shown that its ambitions extend much further: over the past decade, China has invested billions of dollars towards strengthening its long arm of control through tactics of transnational repression. In November of 2023, on the streets of San Francisco, this transnational repression took the form of alarming cases of physical violence and online harassment by organizations and individuals affiliated with the Chinese government, aimed at intimidating and discouraging activists from confronting Xi during his visit. Countries around the world have identified China’s transnational repression as a direct threat to freedom everywhere, yet there remains an expansive gap between rhetoric and action. This report by the Hong Kong Democracy Council and Students for a Free Tibet shines a light on the importance and urgency of enacting meaningful measures against transnational repression. Each case outlined in this report represents a brazen attempt by the Chinese government to silence the truth and stamp out dissent in broad daylight on American soil. 

As masked thugs with metal poles openly roamed the streets of San Francisco, Tibetan and Hong Konger youth, some as young as 15 or 16 years old, were often left to fend for themselves. Rather than hopelessness, though, what we witnessed on the streets of San Francisco was the sheer grit and resilience of our communities: a determination by activists and human rights defenders to exercise our right to free speech and peaceful protest. We saw young people using creative tactics to outsmart one of the world’s best resourced authoritarian governments, while documenting everything along the way. Activists used mass group chats and buddy systems, Hong Kongers shared useful tips gleaned from their dark experiences protesting in the streets of Hong Kong, and Tibetans spread their resilient sense of community developed through decades of organizing in exile. 

During the 11 years since Xi took power, while he has relentlessly chipped away at any remaining spaces to advance democracy and freedom, community organizers and youth activists fighting against China’s colonial rule have learned one crucial lesson: we can stand together, or perish alone. Amidst our shared struggle, we bring our cross-movement spirit from marching the streets of San Francisco to launching this first-of-its-kind documentation: the Hong Kong Democracy Council and Students for a Free Tibet are humbled to jointly publish “Welcoming Xi: Chinese Communist Party Transnational Repression on the Streets of San Francisco.”

<h2  id="executivesummary" class="text-4xl font-extrabold py-10 underline decoration-amber-300 underline-offset-8 decoration-8 ">Executive Summary</h2>


This report documents acts of transnational repression (TNR) carried out by supporters of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) against protesters during the visit to San Francisco in November 2023 of Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic of China. In all, 34 cases of harassment, intimidation, and assault are presented. 

The report shows the mobilization and involvement of the CCP’s “united front” network in the United States (US). In many cases, united front groups and figures were present during acts of assault, intimidation, and harassment, and some actively participated in them. The report also documents coordination among CCP supporters that suggests direction and planning. Their actions created a pervasive atmosphere of intimidation that not only had a deterrent effect on protests throughout the duration of Xi’s stay but also interfered with protesters’ exercise of their free speech rights.

Most of the victims of the attacks were American citizens and residents, and all but one of the victims of the attacks had roots in China, East Turkestan, Hong Kong or Tibet. All were targets of TNR in San Francisco for demonstrating their opposition to Xi and the CCP. Some had previously been targets of repression in their homelands, or targets of CCP TNR, or both. 

The report also examines the response mechanisms of US policymakers and law enforcement authorities at both federal and local levels. Despite strong awareness of CCP TNR at the federal level and a general commitment to countering it, agencies were unprepared to do so in San Francisco. Local law enforcement authorities exhibited a lack of awareness of TNR, were often unresponsive when alerted to the attacks, and took little and inadequate action in response to the attacks. The result was that protesters were insufficiently protected and perpetrators have not been held accountable.

This report makes 18 recommendations to the White House, relevant federal agencies, Congress, state and local authorities, and the United Nations, and includes  the following recommendations: 

- Investigate whether united front groups in the US are acting as unregistered foreign agents of the PRC in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
- Implement additional vetting for diplomatic visas issued to PRC applicants and screening for applicants connected to TNR activities.
- Offer protection to groups on US soil that are subject to TNR, including by expediting asylum cases and upgrading the existing Deferred Enforced Departure program for Hong Kongers to a Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation.
- Pass legislation creating resources to combat TNR, such as the Transnational Repression Policy Act (H.R. 3654/S.831), the Stop Transnational Repression Act (H.R. 5907), the Combating Transnational Repression Act of 2024 (H.R. 7443), the Law Enforcement Support and Transnational Repression Hotline Act (H.R. 7433), and the Strengthening State and Local Efforts to Combat Transnational Repression Act (H.R. 7439).
- Maintain relations with a diversity of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) groups representing different political views and identities and conduct due diligence on these groups’ backgrounds.

<h2  id="methodology" class="text-4xl font-extrabold py-10 underline decoration-amber-300 underline-offset-8 decoration-8 ">Methodology</h2>


This report is based primarily on the testimonies of 26 protesters and one journalist who were present in San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit from November 14 to 17, 2023, as well as on video and photographic evidence provided by protesters. Media reports and social media posts have also been of some assistance. 

We have attempted to document all cases of harassment and intimidation of and assault on protesters that we came across. All cases described in detail have been substantiated by testimonies of participants and witnesses and/or video and photographic evidence. 

We have attempted to identify those involved in attacks on protesters through the use of open-source research and facial recognition technology. 

We have identified some groups and individuals as belonging to the Chinese Communist Party’s “united front,” meaning that evidence was found indicating that they have associated with Party organs and/or officials and/or representatives of the People’s Republic of China, and have taken actions aligned with the Party’s agenda. In most cases that evidence was found in reporting by Chinese-language media and on websites of Party organs or united front groups.

We have attempted to contact all of those identified in the report as CCP supporters as well as private security firms perceived to be associated with CCP supporters through email, telephone calls and letters. We notified them that they are mentioned in the report, asked if we might ask them some questions, and offered them the opportunity to respond and comment. As of May 15, 2024, most have not responded. None has responded affirmatively. In many cases, these groups and individuals have little to no online presence or website. Many of the email addresses and phone numbers they have made available online or in tax documents proved to be incorrect, out of date, or inoperative. In the first instance, we contacted them by telephone or email at the numbers and addresses that could be found. Where that did not succeed, and in cases where post addresses could be found, we sent letters to them. Only two could be reached by phone. Both made clear they did not wish to speak with us. One responded to email inquiries. None responded to letters.Of those identified in the report as being present on the streets of San Francisco during Xi’s visit, we have not been able to find contact information for three leaders of united front groups, one CCP member based in the PRC, and one convicted felon with no known united front leadership position.

We have also reached out to the San Francisco Police Department, the South San Francisco Police Department, and the San Mateo Sheriff’s Office for information and comment.. 

Where we have received responses, we have included those in the report.

<h2  id="intro" class="text-4xl font-extrabold py-10 underline decoration-amber-300 underline-offset-8 decoration-8 ">Introduction</h2>

In November 2023, Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), came to San Francisco to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit and meet United States (US) President Joe Biden. During Xi’s stay in the city from November 14 to 17, hundreds of Chinese, Hong Kongers, Tibetans, and Uyghurs demonstrated against Xi and the CCP’s harsh crackdown in their homelands.<sup>[^1]</sup> Dozens of protesters were harassed, intimidated, and assaulted. These attacks were carried out by CCP supporters or those acting on their behalf in what appeared to be an organized and coordinated manner. Leaders of united front groups in the US that have been linked to the CCP were involved in the attacks. The attacks constitute transnational repression (TNR) as they targeted opponents of the CCP in the US. Although the US government has identified countering TNR as a top priority, awareness and preparation on the part of law enforcement authorities in San Francisco appeared inadequate.<sup>[^2]</sup> 

This report describes the attacks on protesters in detail and  is based primarily on interviews and testimonies of 26 protesters and one journalist, most of whom were victims of harassment, intimidation, and assault, as well as on photographic and video evidence. It highlights the attacks as a serious instance of transnational repression. It also identifies united front figures involved in the attacks. The report calls on the US government as well as local governments and law enforcement authorities at both the federal and local levels to identify shortcomings and improve efforts to: 

1. prevent and counter transnational repression; 
1. protect the rights of protesters and human rights defenders; and 
1. hold perpetrators of transnational repression accountable.

The protesters were from different backgrounds. Most have their origins in China, East Turkestan, Hong Kong, and Tibet. Many are American citizens, and almost all reside in the US. This is a story that needs to be told because it is part of the history of these peoples—Chinese, Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Uyghurs—fighting for their freedom and their human rights, but it also needs to be told to assist authorities in the US and other countries to more effectively counter CCP transnational repression on their own soil.

At the center of the report is a detailed, chronological narrative of the attacks perpetrated by CCP supporters on protesters while Xi Jinping visited San Francisco. Preceding that are brief sections on the CCP and its overseas united front and on the US government’s prioritization of countering TNR in general and CCP TNR specifically. Following the chronological narrative are sections on responses and reactions to the attacks in San Francisco, analysis, and recommendations.


<h2  id="overseasunitedfront" class="text-4xl font-extrabold py-10 underline decoration-amber-300 underline-offset-8 decoration-8 ">The CCP and It's Overseas United Front</h2>


In order to understand the transnational repression that took place in San Francisco, it is important to understand the network of organizations that enabled the repression and appeared to coordinate in organizing it.

The CCP puts enormous effort and resources into exerting influence and control over what it considers to be Chinese diaspora communities around the world, including not just Chinese immigrants and their families but also Hong Kongers, Taiwanese, Tibetans, and Uyghurs living abroad.

These efforts to control diaspora communities are closely tied to the CCP concept of the “united front” (統一戰線), the idea that the cultivation of support of and loyalty to the Party at home and abroad is central to maintaining the CCP’s power. To that end, the CCP employs both a set of directly-controlled party organs and a larger number of loosely linked overseas groups to carry out its united front strategy. In practice, the term “united front work” (統戰工作) is used rather elastically and can refer to activities carried out by both official agencies and informally associated overseas groups.<sup>[^3]</sup>

### United Front: Main Organs and Overseas Affiliates

Though these types of organizations are often grouped together as part of a loosely-defined “CCP United Front,” this report takes care to differentiate between the two:

Specifically, this report uses the term “United Front” (capitalized) to denote organizations which are constituent parts of the Chinese Communist Party, fully folded into Party infrastructure and directly controlled and operated by CCP authorities. On the other hand, this report uses the term “united front groups” (lowercase letters) to describe overseas groups which may not necessarily have formal ties with the CCP and its United Front agencies, but are often used to carry out the CCP’s agenda. 

The United Front Work Department (中共中央統一戰線工作部/UFWD) is the CCP organ formally in charge of the CCP’s united front strategy. Its work is supplemented by that of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese (中華全國歸國華僑聯合會/ACFROC), a key United Front organization that, in 2018, was designated by the CCP as the main organ responsible for relations with overseas Chinese.<sup>[^4]</sup> ACFROC maintains provincial and municipal offices within the PRC that help maintain relations with Chinese expatriates from these localities. This report documents several connections between members of united front groups and local ACFROC offices.

PRC embassies and consulates also play a key role in cultivating united front groups overseas, often providing them with guidance and direction at key junctures. This report documents many instances in which key figures in united front groups met with or participated in events together with high-ranking PRC consulate officials. 

Typically, CCP officials overseeing united front groups prefer that they preserve a facade of autonomy from CCP United Front organs like the UFWD and ACFROC, as well as from PRC consulates. As noted by Anne-Marie Brady, an academic and expert on the overseas United Front, the CCP “wants to avoid being seen to ‘lead’ [領導] the overseas Chinese community, but rather prefers to be seen to ‘guide’ [引導] them.”<sup>[^5]</sup>

In actuality, however, united front groups rarely if ever deviate from the CCP’s official stance on any matter. Generally speaking, CCP United Front officials strive to create a situation where overseas united front groups will know the Party’s will and do the Party’s bidding without requiring official direction or supervision. Brady notes that “[t]he goal of successful overseas Chinese work is to get the community to proactively and even better, spontaneously, engage in activities which enhance China’s foreign policy agenda.”<sup>[^6]</sup>

Because of this strategy, civic organizations in diaspora communities may have united front links. United front groups may take the form of hometown associations, business associations, Chinese Students and Scholars Association chapters at foreign universities, or associations for the so-called “peaceful reunification of China” (the CCP’s preferred term for its efforts to bring Taiwan under CCP rule). Groups of this nature tend to display strong signs of united front links, and often have members who maintain close communication with CCP United Front organs and appear at public events with PRC officials.

These groups also often seek to cultivate relations with politicians and officials—especially local politicians and officials—in the countries in which they operate, claiming to broadly represent the political views and concerns of the “Chinese community” or even the “Asian community,” crowding out a far more diverse representation of voices, especially those with views different from the CCP’s. In the US, local politicians and officials often meet these united front groups without appearing to be aware of their links to the CCP. While there is no official public list of united front organizations, organizations that exhibit many of the characteristics mentioned above appear frequently in this report as they and their leaders were present on the streets of San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit. 

Additionally, many Chinese-language media outlets which are widely read in diaspora communities are nowadays controlled or influenced to one extent or another by the CCP or by businesses and interests loyal to the CCP.<sup>[^7]</sup> As such, they too may be considered part of a broader united front strategy. Much of the information about united front groups found in this report comes from pro-CCP Chinese-language diaspora media.

### United Front: Understanding Its Goals through the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, 2008 Beijing Olympics, and 2019 Hong Kong Pro-Democracy Protests

While CCP efforts to cultivate the loyalty of overseas Chinese to the regime date back to the founding of the PRC in 1949 and even before, the current objectives of CCP united front work are multifaceted. The development of these new objectives can be traced to the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre, which marked a turning point in CCP relations with the diaspora. 

In 1989, many overseas Chinese were shocked and outraged by the Tiananmen Massacre on June 4. The CCP realized it had a significant problem on its hands: criticism and doubts about the regime’s legitimacy were widespread at home and abroad. The political crisis led the CCP to increase its efforts to cultivate the loyalty of groups in Chinese-origin communities abroad, with the goal of securing the CCP’s political power among overseas Chinese. 

The 1990s in particular, but also the following decades, have been a boom time for the development of the united front in the US. This development coincided with increased migration from the PRC to the US and a large increase in the number of Chinese students at US universities. Recent migrants and Chinese students became the main targets of united front work and often the main groups tasked with carrying it out. The PRC also experienced rapid economic growth in this period, allowing the CCP to exert greater influence around the world, including on diaspora communities.

While the earlier model of united front work focused on securing the CCP’s political power and exerting the CCP’s influence, the united front work this report examines in San Francisco includes a broader range of goals, astroturfing public support for the CCP in the United states and neutralizing public displays of opposition among them. 

These objectives of CCP united front work have been observed as far back as the 2008 global Olympic torch relay.<sup>[^8]</sup> The CCP considered the Beijing Olympics of 2008 as China’s grand coming-out to the world, and its global Olympic torch relay the glorious prologue. Therefore, when large numbers of protesters turned out during early stops on the torch’s tour and seriously damaged the effectiveness of the propaganda campaign, the CCP rapidly mobilized united front groups in Australia and Japan to ensure that the same wouldn’t happen in those places. The torch relay in San Francisco was also targeted for united front mobilization. These mobilized united front groups gathered to display overseas support for CCP leadership and to identify, manage and neutralize any signs of opposition to CCP leaders and policies (i.e., protests).

The CCP regarded these efforts as so successful that they still serve as the template for overseas public events the CCP considers to be related to its core interests, such as foreign visits of top Party leaders and sovereignty over East Turkestan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Tibet.

It is important to the CCP that it hide its controlling hand in the mobilization of overseas support. For the global Olympic torch relay stops in Australia and Japan in 2008, CCP officials and their agents initially boasted of their mobilization efforts, but when the Party began to perceive an international media backlash amid accusations of “rent-a-crowds,” it did what scholar James Jiann Hua To referred to as a “public ‘about face’ on openly supporting” these groups. Consequently, according to To, Chinese state media reports “emphasized that students had mobilized themselves and established the rallies at their own will,” and statements by PRC officials either “denied any involvement or deflected questions surrounding the embassies’ provocation of [overseas Chinese] nationalism. Furthermore, student groups were instructed to deny any links between the rallies and the embassy….”<sup>[^9]</sup> Since then, the same denial has followed countless welcoming parades and events.

The mass protests in Hong Kong in 2019 were another moment when the CCP felt its political leadership challenged and threatened, not just in Hong Kong but globally. Hong Kongers around the world showed support for the protests, with demonstrations in dozens of cities. The CCP mobilized the united front to counter these protests. According to a report by Alliance Canada Hong Kong, threats against and harassment of Hong Kong demonstrators were reported in 25 cities worldwide, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Germany, Denmark, France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada and the US.<sup>[^10]</sup> 

This report describes a repeating pattern of attacks on protesters during Xi Jinping’s 2023 visit to San Francisco. This pattern is defined by the following aspects:

1. United front groups and figures involved in the CCP-supporting and counter-protest efforts are non-state actors\. While their exact relation to the CCP as an institution may be somewhat vague or unclear, they are not formally, openly, or explicitly incorporated into Party structures\. In other words, the CCP is effectively “outsourcing” repressive actions. 
2. there are clear and well-documented connections between (i) the state organs of the PRC such as embassies and consulates, (ii) United Front organs that are formal parts of CCP infrastructure in the PRC, and (iii) overseas united front groups that are informally connected to the party structure\. 

It is worth noting that while the pro-CCP public assemblies “welcoming Xi” were intended to present a peaceful face of “patriotic” support for China and for good relations between China and the US, in fact their motives also involved neutralizing any manifestation of opposition to Xi or the CCP. The strong motive to neutralize dissent has led to repressive actions not short of harassment, intimidation, and assault, and as such, has resulted in acts of transnational repression. It is further worth noting that not all individuals associated with these groups participated in harassment, intimidation and assault. 

### Attacks on Protesters as a Form of Transnational Repression

While many different forms of CCP TNR against Chinese, Hong Kongers, Tibetans and Uyghurs have been documented, attacks on protesters at public events is a particular form of CCP TNR that has received relatively little attention, a gap which this report seeks to fill. 

There is copious documentation of CCP transnational repression targeting diaspora communities, to which the protesters who were attacked in San Francisco belong. Cases of TNR against Hong Kongers include not only the harassment and intimidation at the 2019 global solidarity protests mentioned above but also the arrest warrants and bounties issued for exiled Hong Kongers in 2023 (for more on that, see below) and the extraordinary assault on a Hong Kong protester by Chinese consulate staff in Manchester, England in October 2022.<sup>[^11]</sup> Tibetans and Uyghurs in the diaspora have also been targeted for TNR, as recent detailed reports have shown.<sup>[^12]</sup>

Freedom House, which monitors transnational repression worldwide, notes that “China conducts the most sophisticated, global, and comprehensive campaign of transnational repression in the world. Efforts by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to pressure and control the overseas population of Chinese and members of minority communities are marked by three distinctive characteristics. First, the campaign targets many groups, including multiple ethnic and religious minorities, political dissidents, human rights activists, journalists, and former insiders accused of corruption. Second, it spans the full spectrum of tactics: from direct attacks like renditions, to co-opting other countries to detain and render exiles, to mobility controls, to threats from a distance like digital threats, spyware, and coercion by proxy. Third, the sheer breadth and global scale of the campaign is unparalleled. Freedom House’s conservative catalog of direct, physical attacks since 2014 covers 214 cases originating from China, far more than any other country.”<sup>[^13]</sup>


<h2  id="countering" class="text-4xl font-extrabold py-10 underline decoration-amber-300 underline-offset-8 decoration-8 ">The US Government on Countering Transnational Repression</h2>

All cases of transnational repression documented in this report took place in the United States. Federal authorities in the US have articulated as a priority countering TNR in general and CCP TNR specifically and have taken some measures to do so in practice. This section reviews the US government’s main statements on the matter and actions taken prior to November 2023. After documenting the cases of TNR that occurred in San Francisco, the report will identify governmental shortcomings in responding to and preventing TNR.

The United States has identified countering transnational repression as a national security and human rights priority. Statements to that effect can be found in the National Security Strategy, the Department of Justice’s (DoJ) strategy on countering nation-state threats; the webpage of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) focusing on TNR; the Declaration of Principles to Combat Transnational Repression at the 2023 Summit for Democracy, and other official documents.

### The White House and the Department of State

The US *National Security Strategy* of 2022 states, “Together with our allies and partners, we are… holding states accountable for violations and abuses of human rights, including… **countering transnational repression**, and standing with people around the world on the front lines of the fight for dignity, equality and justice.”<sup>[^14]</sup>

In 2023, one year after the publication of the *National Security Strategy,* the US was one of 11 countries that endorsed the *Declaration of Principles to Combat Transnational Repression at the Summit for Democracy*.<sup>[^15]</sup> The US has also reported on CCP TNR in its annual *Country Reports on Human Rights Practices*.<sup>[^16]</sup> In January 2024, the US asked about CCP TNR at the PRC’s Universal Periodic Review at the United Nations Human Rights Council.<sup>[^17]</sup>

In 2022, the Department of State took action against PRC officials involved in TNR.<sup>[^18]</sup> On three occasions in 2023, the Department of State issued statements denouncing PRC transnational repression in response to the arrest warrants and bounties of HK$1 million each issued by the Hong Kong national security police against Hong Kongers in exile, some of whom reside in the United States and one of whom is an American citizen.<sup>[^19]</sup>

The Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation

In February 2022, the Assistant Attorney General for National Security at the Department of Justice announced a new *Strategy for Countering Nation-State Threats*. While naming four states as particularly problematic, the strategy says “the government of China stands apart… The PRC government threatens our security through its concerted use of espionage, theft of trade secrets, malicious cyber activity, **transnational repression**, and other tactics to advance its interests — all to the detriment of the United States and other democratic nations and their citizens around the world.”<sup>[^20]</sup> 

The FBI’s definition of transnational repression is the following: “When foreign governments stalk, intimidate, or assault people in the United States, it is considered transnational repression.”<sup>[^21]</sup> 

Much of the DoJ and FBI’s work countering transnational repression focuses on cases perpetrated by individuals acting on behalf of the PRC. From the start of 2020 to January 2024, at least 78 individuals were charged with federal crimes related to CCP TNR for a variety of actions including harassing and threatening Chinese pro-democracy activists, operating an illegal overseas Chinese police station, conducting an online harassment campaign against Chinese dissidents, and attempting to forcibly repatriate a Chinese national living in the US. They have been charged with various crimes, such as acting as an agent of a foreign government without providing notification to the US Attorney General, stalking, transmitting interstate threats, committing interstate harassment, obstructing justice, and bribery, among others.<sup>[^22]</sup>

### Limitations and Challenges

In spite of the US government’s classification of countering transnational repression as a priority and its related law enforcement efforts, a Government Accountability Office report of October 2023 concluded that the US government is failing in its efforts to counter transnational repression. 

Currently, there is no specific law criminalizing TNR. FBI officials say gaps in US law limit the bureau’s ability to counter TNR. At the same time, no government-wide definition of TNR has been established either by agencies or through legislation. 

There is a lack of coordination between federal, state, and local authorities. While federal authorities and officers are aware of TNR as an issue and a concept, local authorities and officers, who are often the first to encounter victims of TNR, are neither trained nor equipped to handle TNR. Thus, cases of TNR are sometimes treated as “ordinary” crimes without identifying the actual or potential involvement of foreign actors, including foreign governments.<sup>[^23]</sup> (See the “Analysis” and “Recommendations” sections below for further discussion.)

It is clear that countering transnational repression—and TNR carried out by the CCP in particular—is a priority for federal authorities, but they have so far been silent in regard to the harassment and intimidation of and assaults on protesters in San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit.  


<h2  id="attacksonprotesters" class="text-4xl font-extrabold py-10 underline decoration-amber-300 underline-offset-8 decoration-8 ">Attacks on Protesters in San Francisco</h2>

### Overview

Hundreds, if not thousands, of CCP supporters were mobilized and transported to San Francisco to “welcome” Xi Jinping. Some came from the Bay Area, while others traveled from as far away as southern California; Portland, Oregon; Seattle; Philadelphia; and New York. It appears that their transport and accommodations were paid for. The mission of “welcoming Xi” was framed as a glorious patriotic duty. United front groups and their leaders were mobilized. Chinese students at universities in the Bay Area and in other areas of California were recruited through chapters of Chinese Students and Scholars Association with close ties to PRC consulates. 

It appears that the purpose of the mobilization of large numbers of CCP supporters was twofold: firstly, to show strong support for Xi Jinping; and secondly, to obscure, neutralize, and. if possible. eliminate any sign of opposition. The ultimate aim was to present a “sea of red” to the “great leader.” Toward that end, the large numbers were crucial. They were used to crowd out and drown out protesters. Among the large numbers, those who would adopt more aggressive measures could blend in and hide. Ordinary items, especially flags and flagpoles, were deployed by some CCP supporters as weapons against protesters. Flags were regularly used to obscure protesters, both to prevent others from seeing them and to block views of assaults. Flagpoles were regularly used to stab and hit protesters. Protesters interviewed for this report frequently had the impression that the actions of CCP supporters were orchestrated and coordinated to a high degree.

This report documents 34 cases of harassment and intimidation of and assault on protesters that occurred over the course of the four days (November 14–17, 2023) that Xi Jinping was in San Francisco  . These actions include threats, attempts to prevent protest, physical attacks and beatings, thefts of cell phones, and incidents of stalking. Other incidents of harassment, intimidation, and assault were reported by the media and/or on social media and are mentioned in the report. The FBI’s definition of transnational repression—“when foreign governments stalk, intimidate, or assault people in the United States”—is certainly applicable in this instance, as many or all of these acts were perpetrated in San Francisco by people taking part in a coordination mobilization campaign with links to the CCP.<sup>[^24]</sup>  

Significantly, most incidents of harassment, intimidation, and assault occurred at locations where Xi Jinping was present or expected to be—in particular, the San Francisco International Airport on his arrival on November 14 and his departure on November 17; and three places in downtown San Francisco: the St Regis San Francisco Hotel, where the Chinese delegation was reported to be staying; the Hyatt Regency Hotel, where Xi attended a banquet held in his honor by US business groups; and the Moscone Center, venue of the APEC summit.

Generally, the actions taken by law enforcement authorities to prevent the attacks, to protect victims of the attacks, and to apprehend and hold accountable perpetrators of the attacks were inadequate. In some cases, police officers appear to have witnessed an attack but to have taken no action. In other cases, protesters reported the attacks to police officers either while they were ongoing or immediately after they took place, but police officers declined to take action. In still other cases, police officers attempted to separate the CCP supporters from the protesters, though they only did so in response to urgent requests from protesters. Where police continued to monitor the situation, the safety of the protesters improved; where they failed to do so, protesters were attacked in the very areas police had set up to protect them. While activists were threatened before Xi Jinping’s visit and law enforcement agencies were made aware of the threats, little to no preventive actions were taken. Police officers on the scene often appeared to have little awareness of the dynamics of what was happening before their eyes and appeared at times indifferent or even hostile and callous toward protesters’ appeals for protection. On only one occasion did anyone interviewed for this report witness a CCP supporter—a man who tried to cross a police barricade to approach protesters,—being taken into custody by the police for an aggressive action toward protesters. The inadequate action by law enforcement authorities put protesters in the position of having to take their own precautions, without which, some protesters interviewed for this report believed, things would have been much worse.

The following section traces the incidents of harassment, intimidation, and assault in chronological order:

- November 11: threats to activists before Xi Jinping’s arrival;
- November 12 to 14: mobilization and transport of CCP supporters;
- November 14: Xi Jinping’s arrival at the San Francisco International Airport; harassment and intimidation at the airport and along the expected route of his motorcade; an assault at the St Regis, where the Chinese delegation is reported to be staying;
- November 15: another assault at the St Regis; multiple attacks at the Hyatt Regency, where a banquet for Xi Jinping is held;
- November 16: multiple attacks near the Moscone Center where Xi attends the APEC summit; and
- November 17: multiple attacks at the San Francisco International Airport when Xi Jinping departs.

Interspersed with accounts of the events as they unfolded are identifications and profiles of united front figures and groups that, to varying extents, were associated with and/or involved in the harassment and intimidation of and assaults on protesters.

### (three days before Xi’s arrival in San Francisco)

Threats against activists were made even before Xi Jinping’s arrival on November 14.

### Threat against Yao Cheng

At least one Chinese activist residing in the United States, Yao Cheng (姚誠), reported that, on November 10, his daughter was summoned to a Ministry of Public Security office in Anhui Province and instructed her to tell him not to go to San Francisco to participate in protests. Yao’s message to the Anhui PSB was, “You inviting her to tea [a common euphemism for interrogation in the PRC] is actually a threat to me.”<sup>[^25]</sup>

### Threats against Uyghurs

Uyghurs also reported cases of Uyghurs in East Turkestan and/or the PRC being contacted by PRC authorities and instructed to tell their relatives living in the United States not to attend any protests against Xi Jinping in San Francisco. A Uyghur leader in the US has confirmed these cases but has said that the Uyghurs in the US whose families were contacted in the PRC do not wish to go on the record about the incidents. The use of families in the PRC/East Turkestan to convey threats to Uyghurs in the diaspora is a well-documented tactic of the CCP.<sup>[^26]</sup> 

### Threats against Anna Kwok

On the morning of November 11, Hong Kong Democracy Council Executive Director Anna Kwok announced on social media that she had arrived in San Francisco and was going to protest against Xi Jinping.<sup>[^27]</sup>

In response, about 12 hours later, she was inundated with online threats: Some encouraged others to apprehend her. Others threatened kidnapping. One said, “Can somebody drop her unconscious body at the Chinese consulate/embassy?”<sup>[^28]</sup> The threats, all sent from what appear to be pseudonymous accounts, appeared to be coordinated. The accounts shared and commented on each other’s comments. Many used the same image: her face on a Hong Kong Police Force’s wanted poster that offered a bounty of HK$1 million for information or assistance leading to her arreSt The US Department of State and governmental authorities in other countries had already denounced the arrest warrants and bounties against Hong Kong activists in exile as transnational repression.


[![anna tweet](/images/anna-tweet.png 'Codey the Codecademy mascot')](https://codecademy.com)


<sup>[^29]</sup>

Kwok said, “All the comments appeared at once. Most of the comments encouraged others to act on the arrest warrant and bounty and hunt me down; they didn’t say they’d do it themselves. They sought to rile up lone wolf patriots who would be mad enough to do it. That way, [those who made the posts on social media] wouldn’t have to pay the legal consequences themselves. It was the same group of 10 or so accounts making the threats. I assume they were coordinated and instructed.”<sup>[^30]</sup>

She reported the threats to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the morning of November 12, sending screenshots as evidence. On November 14, an agent at the FBI’s San Francisco office contacted her. She was told to call 911 if she faced any life-threatening event. The agent told her that the FBI had contacted relevant authorities in San Francisco about the incident and provided San Francisco Police Department precincts with her name and photo.<sup>[^31]</sup>

Over the following days, Kwok said, “There were multiple moments when I knew others were threatened and harassed. When I reached out to the FBI, likely because I was the one who had well-documented threats prior to the occasion, I was the ‘person of interest’ in the system. In other words, the process catered more toward my safety and well-being instead of protecting all protesters on site. When asked about actions they could take, the options are limited. The FBI could not intervene in the on-site command chain of local law enforcement. When I spoke to the police on site, they were not equipped with knowledge of the situation; nor did they understand that this was transnational repression happening before their eyes. Some of them were even unaware of the fact that there were two sides and one was intimidating the other. The FBI agents wanted to help but struggled to find the mechanisms to do so.

### (and other days leading up to Xi Jinping’s arrival)

In the days leading up to Xi Jinping’s arrival in San Francisco on November 14, reports began to emerge that large numbers of CCP supporters were being transported to San Francisco from southern California, New York, and Philadelphia. (Later, evidence of groups from Portland, Oregon; Seattle, Washington; and the San Francisco Bay Area itself also emerged.)

### Mobilization of Chinese Students through CSSAs

Hundreds of Chinese students were bused in from California universities, including the University of California (UC) at San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, UC Los Angeles, and California State University, Northridge.<sup>[^32]</sup>

Chinese Students and Scholars Association (中國學生學者聯合（誼）會) branches at California universities were used to recruit Chinese students to “welcome” Xi, as could be seen in messages circulating among students and scholars at California universities.

CSSAs have a record of surveilling and reporting on Chinese students. They are collectively overseen by the CCP’s United Front Work Department and are often controlled, funded, and/or closely watched by Chinese embassies or consulates. The US Department of State says, “…the CCP created the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA) to monitor Chinese students and mobilize them against views that dissent from the CCP’s stance. That directive has not changed.”<sup>[^33]</sup> The United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission says CSSAs “receive guidance from the CCP through Chinese embassies and consulates—governmental ties the CSSAs frequently attempt to conceal—and are active in carrying out overseas Chinese work consistent with Beijing’s United Front strategy.”<sup>[^34]</sup>

An email message from a “BCSSA Official”at UC Berkeley told Chinese students that transport to welcoming events for Xi Jinping and meals would be arranged and provided. 


![Berkeley-CSSA-email-cropped.png](/images/Berkeley-CSSA-email-cropped.png)  

Berkeley CSSA students were later seen on November 14 at the “welcome” gathering for Xi Jinping near the San Francisco International Airport. As many as 45 students posed for group photos with the Berkeley CSSA banner.

![UC-Berkeley-Chinese-students-5.jpeg](/images/UC-Berkeley-Chinese-students-5.jpeg) 

A message addressed to “executive committee members” said that CSSA representatives at University of Southern California were informed by the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles that Xi Jinping would be visiting and that students belonging to the USC CSSA were invited. Students were expected to stay in San Francisco for three or four days, the duration of Xi’s visit, and, “for everyone’s safety,” would not be allowed to go out on their own or engage in separate activities. This message also said that all travel, accommodation, and food expenses would be covered, notified students that this “glorious mission” was a significant duty, and advised addressees not to share the contents of the message  with others. The message also said that once people signed up, they could not withdraw.

![USC-CSSA-APEC-invite](/images/USC-CSSA-APEC-invite.jpeg)

The same message addressed to executive committee members of the USC CSSA was also sent to the UCLA CSSA executive committee members. 

![UCLA-CSSA](/images/UCLA-CSSA.png)


A video posted online by a Chinese student in the US confirms that, while the event  was coordinated by CSSAs, the buses and meals were provided by the PRC Consulate.<sup>[^35]</sup>A Chinese student who traveled to San Francisco said the PRC Consulate paid for flight tickets from New York City and accommodations.<sup>[^36]</sup>  

It is highly likely that CSSAs at other California universities and in other states were used to mobilize Chinese students in a similar fashion. 

Many young people who were presumably students were, in particular, gathered along the airport access road with PRC flags on November 14, the day of Xi Jinping’s arrival.

### Mobilization and Transport of Other United Front Groups

In fact, over the course of the four days of Xi Jinping’s visit to San Francisco, **students** in general did not appear to make up a large percentage of the CCP supporters at events and locations other than those at the airport on November 14. The majority of CCP supporters appeared to be associated with other united front groups. 

It was reported by Chinese-language media with good relations with the CCP supporters that between 16 and 20 buses transported about 800 CCP supporters from southern California to San Francisco. The daily cost of each bus rental was at least $5,000. At least 400 rooms were reserved at five different hotels at a rate of at least $150 a night. The entire mobilization from southern California alone was said to have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Almost 1,000 CCP supporters from New York and other areas were transported to San Francisco. The report estimated that altogether as many as 10,000 CCP supporters from various regions would gather in San Francisco.<sup>[^37]</sup>

Overseas Chinese from southern California were also reported to have hired 10 armed, uniformed security guards to “maintain order on site.”<sup>[^38]</sup> Over the coming days, security guards who appeared to be associated with CCP supporters were present at all but one of the locations where protesters were harassed, intimidated, and assaulted. At least two private security firms were employed.<sup>[^39]</sup> The guards of one firm dressed in distinctive black suits that protesters came to recognize. The guards of the other wore uniforms, and many appeared strikingly young (fFor more details on these security firms, see below). Apart from a united front leader from southern California who claimed to have hired the 10 guards mentioned above, it is unclear who exactly hired the security guards. In response to our query regarding who hired the security firms, a representative of one of the firms said, “I recommend contacting the Chinese consulate directly for the details you're looking for.”<sup>[^40]</sup> The security guards were seen at times to be working with individuals who may have had direct ties to the PRC. (See below for details.) The guards’ exact responsibilities and purpose often appeared unclear; at times, they themselves appeared not to know. Some protesters reported that the security guards acted aggressively towards them and asserted the authority to determine where they were and were not allowed to be, while other security guards appeared to have little idea of what they were doing or remained inactive in response to incidents of harassment, intimidation, and assault (see below for details).

United front groups that traveled from southern California to San Francisco include the All American Chinese Association<sup>[^41]</sup> (南加華人華僑聯合總會/美國南加州華人華僑聯合總會), the Chinese American Unity Alliance (洛杉磯華埠大聯盟), and the Taishan Friendship Association of Southern California (南加台山聯誼會).<sup>[^42]</sup> 

Other united front groups that traveled to San Francisco include the Philadelphia Fujian Association (費城福建同鄉會), the American Lianjiang Association (美國連江同鄉會; Lianjiang is a county in Fujian Province), the American Fujian Association (美國福建同鄉會), the North American Zhejiang Overseas Chinese Association (北美浙江華僑聯盟社團), and the Los Angeles-based Beijing Association USA (美國北京聯合會).<sup>[^43]</sup> 

While some united front groups seek to obscure their close links with CCP entities and officials, others proudly display them. For example, on the front page of Beijing Association USA’s website are two letters congratulating it. One is from the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese (中華全國歸國華僑聯合會), the top-level CCP United Front group tasked with overseeing relations with overseas Chinese that is mentioned in the introduction above. The other is from China Overseas Friendship Association (中華海外聯誼會), the external name of the 9th Bureau of the CCP’s United Front Work Department, one of two UFWD bureaus tasked with overseeing overseas Chinese affairs.<sup>[^44]</sup>  

Beijing Association USA was one of many united front groups seen lining the route to the Filoli Estate where the meeting between Xi Jinping and President Biden took place on November 15.

![Screen-Shot-2024-02-12-at-10.16.41-AM](/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-12-at-10.16.41-AM.png)
<sup>[^45]</sup>

Another group present along the Filoli route on the 15th was the America Cultural Center Of Chinese Minorities (美國中華民族文化中心) based in Arcadia, California.

![Screen-Shot-2024-02-12-at-10.27.32-AM](/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-12-at-10.27.32-AM.png)
<sup>[^46]</sup>

Like many united front groups in the US, the America Cultural Center Of Chinese Minorities has a minimal public profile, but it is registered as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.<sup>[^47]</sup> 

### United Front Leaders Who Organized Mobilization and Transport

Two individuals were prominent among united front leaders who organized the mobilization and transportation of CCP supporters to San Francisco. 

One of these individuals is Charles Lu Qiang (鹿強). Chinese-language media outlets *Sing Tao* and *World Journal* reported that he organized the mobilization of CCP supporters from southern California. The other is John Chen Shanzhuang (陳善莊) who reportedly organized the mobilization of CCP supporters from New York. 

Brief profiles of these two individuals reveal their ties to the CCP. Tracing these ties helps to indicate how the CCP uses united front groups to carry out its agenda abroad. 


> Charles Lu Qiang (鹿強), a travel agent based in the Los Angeles area, reportedly organized the transport of 16 to 20 buses of CCP supporters from southern California to San Francisco. Lu utilized the resources of his travel agency to secure transportation.<sup>[^48]</sup>

> As recently as September 2023, two months before Xi Jinping’s visit to San Francisco, Lu attended the 11th National Congress of Returned Overseas Chinese (第十一次全國歸僑僑眷代表大會) in Beijing, where Xi Jinping and other top CCP leaders spoke.<sup>[^49]</sup>

> Lu has served as an overseas committee member of the Shanghai Qiao Lian (上海市僑聯), a local group of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese (中華全國歸國華僑聯合會) in Shanghai. <sup>[^50]</sup> ACFROC (中國僑聯 [簡稱]) is the top-level CCP United Front group responsible for maintaining relations between the CCP and overseas Chinese.<sup>[^51]</sup>

> In 2015, Lu was one of 38 overseas Chinese invited to attend the main annual session of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (中國人民政治協商會議; CPPCC), the very highest United Front organ of the CCP and an advisory body to the PRC government composed of some of the highest-profile CCP supporters. An invitation to an overseas Chinese to attend the annual session of the CPPCC is considered recognition of exceptional contributions to united front work abroad; only “well-known leaders in their host countries” are invited to attend. Lu claimed the conference had an especially good democratic atmosphere. The CPPCC session took place in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.<sup>[^52]</sup> 

> Lu is the honorary founding chairman of the Roundtable of Southern California Chinese-American Organizations (RCAO; 美國南加州華人社團聯合會[簡稱南華聯]). As of 2022, RCAO was a coalition made up of at least 170 member organizations. At a ceremony in 2022 inaugurating its 10th leadership team—of which Lu is part in his capacity as honorary founding chairman—Zhang Ping, the then-Consul General of the PRC consulate in Los Angeles, expressed admiration for the work of the RCAO as well as gratitude to its past and present leaders. Lu is prominent among them in photos of the event. In one, he stands next to Zhang Sujiu, daughter of General Zhang Zhizhong, whom Mao Zedong appointed to several high-ranking positions in the early decades of the PRC. Zhang herself is, like Lu, an honorary chair of RCAO.<sup>[^53]</sup>

> Lu is also reputed to be a major convener of “patriotic” gatherings of overseas Chinese in southern California to “oppose Taiwan and Hong Kong independence.”<sup>[^54]</sup>

> In addition to having transported 16 to 20 buses of CCP supporters to San Francisco, Lu Qiang himself, along with hundreds of other CCP supporters, was apparently present along the route to the Filoli Estate where the Xi-Biden meeting was held on November 15.<sup>[^55]</sup>


</br> 


> John Chen Shanzhuang (陳善莊), (sometimes spelled “John Chan” in English) reportedly played a leading role in mobilizing CCP supporters from New York. He is reported to be the chair of Asian American Community Empowerment (美國亞裔社團聯合總會).<sup>[^56]</sup> He was interviewed on the streets of San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit, and the accompanying photograph shows him wearing a lapel pin of the American Chinese Commerce Association (HK) (美國(香港)旅美華人總商會), **another group** of which he is the chair.<sup>
[^57]</sup>

> ![Screen-Shot-2024-03-01-at-9.24.40-AM](/images/Screen-Shot-2024-03-01-at-9.24.40-AM.png)

> On November 8, only days before he led CCP supporters to San Francisco, Chen met Deputy Consul General Wu Xiaoming (吳曉明) of the PRC consulate in New York.<sup>[^58]</sup> The occasion was a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new office for his organization, Asian American Community Empowerment. Wu publicly praised Chen, indicating a close relationship between PRC officials and Chen as a leader of united front groups.

> Chen has been a leader of united front activities in New York City for upward of three decades, regularly organizing public gatherings to express support for PRC government positions on matters ranging from the US bombing of the PRC embassy in Belgrade in 1999 to the Falun Gong.<sup>[^59]</sup> In March 2023, Chen was prominent at a protest of CCP supporters in New York City against the visit to the US of the Taiwanese then-president Tsai Ing-wen.<sup>[^60]</sup>

> In 1999, he co-founded the American Fuzhou Langqi United Association (美國福州琅岐聯合總會). He is also listed as the chairman of the American Chinese Commerce Association (美華總商會會長), which shares a website with the American Chinese Commerce Association (Hong Kong) (美國(香港)旅美華人總商會), of which he is also president. Besides the organizations mentioned above, he is also reported to be the convener of an organization called Coalition of Asian-Americans for Civil Rights (CAACR) (亞裔維權大聯盟).<sup>[^61]</sup>

> In San Francisco, Chen led supporters in “welcoming” Xi outside the St Regis Hotel, where the Chinese delegation was staying, on November 14. Some of them harassed and intimidated protesters.

> <video src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfake54t/video/upload/v1719548929/AtSlH8nNhO_tnuUi_plqras.mp4"  controls class="sm:w-full lg:w-1/2 h-80 " allow="autoplay"></video> 

> <sup>[^62]</sup>

Besides united front figures like Lu Qiang and Chen Shanzhuang, who reportedly organized the mobilization and transport of CCP supporters to San Francisco from, respectively, southern California and New York, several other prominent united front leaders participated in the “welcoming” of Xi Jinping in San Francisco. They will be noted as they appear in the timeline of events below.

Patterns emerge that resemble previous mobilizations of the overseas united front to neutralize protesters going back to the Olympic torch relay in 2008: 

- The united front groups have strong ties with the PRC government and are organized by individuals with a record of strong ties with the PRC government. 
- Their mobilization is organized and transport and accommodations are provided. 
- Those associated with united front groups, including Chinese students, are exhorted to fulfill their patriotic duty and take part in a “glorious mission.”

While a small percentage of CCP supporters who showed up on the streets of San Francisco directly engaged in acts of harassment of and assault on protesters, the mobilization of large numbers is meant to “flood the zone,” taking up space especially in locations where Xi is present. This is effected both to ensure support for Xi and to neutralize potential protests. The CCP supporters blast patriotic songs and slogans on megaphones at high volume and seek to obscure any views of protesters, and their banners and flags. Within the crowds of CCP supporters, many of whom are quite passive, are smaller numbers of people who are tasked or who take it upon themselves to more aggressively harass, intimidate, and even assault protesters. A number of those who do not directly take these more aggressive measures are nevertheless sometimes perceived as complicit with those who do, if they use, for example, their PRC flags to block any view of the harassment, intimidation, and assault. Kennedy Wong, a Hong Kong protester and member of Hong Kong Democracy Council, said, “I was quite frightened because we were outnumbered by CCP supporters; more importantly, some of them were very aggressive.”<sup>[^63]</sup> 

On several occasions, protesters changed their plans due to safety concerns. Tibetan and Uyghur groups had originally planned to march on November 15 to the Hyatt Regency, where Xi was the guest of honor at a banquet, but when they saw the large numbers of CCP supporters gathered outside the hotel and an absence of separate protest zones, they decided against this course of action as they feared it could lead to a potentially violent confrontation. Several dozen Tibetans proceeded to the area near the Hyatt Regency, but many Tibetan elders along with Tibetans with children left.<sup>[^64]</sup> (In fact, those protesters who did brave the crowds of CCP supporters were attacked, as shall be seen.) Once on site, protesters quickly developed protocols and strategies to ensure their safety. Often, the effort required of protesters to protect themselves from pro-CCP attackers distracted significant attention from their original objective, namely, protesting against Xi Jinping. All protesters interviewed for this report said they felt in significant danger and were on constant high alert for attacks, stalking, and other forms of harassment, intimidation, and violence. The mobilization of the united front as well as more aggressive agents affiliated with the CCP did, in fact, deter protest and create an unsafe environment for protest, thus interfering with protesters’ free speech rights as well as infringing their basic human right to freedom of peaceful assembly.

### (first day of Xi’s Visit to San Francisco)

Xi Jinping arrived at the San Francisco International Airport. He and the Chinese delegation were rumored to be staying at the St Regis hotel. Hundreds of CCP supporters lined the route from the airport to the hotel and also gathered near the hotel. Some protesters also went to the airport, a few were present along the route of Xi’s motorcade, and a few more were near the hotel. The first incidents of harassment, intimidation, and assault occurred on this day.

Among the serious incidents of the day were these:

- The harassment and intimidation of Uyghur camp survivor Tursunay Ziyawudun and other Uyghurs at the San Francisco International Airport.
- The harassment and intimidation of Chinese activist Li Huanjun on the route from the airport to the St Regis.
- The assault on Chinese activist Jia Junwei outside the St Regis

To many protesters in San Francisco, Chen was recognizable as the bald-headed man who was seen at many incidents of intimidation, harassment, and assault during Xi Jinping’s visit (see below for more on Chen Wenshen).See 华盛顿艺术, “华州福建工商会成立庆典," 18 Mar 2019, http://arthundred.com/index.php?a=shows&catid=21&id=917 and 西雅图中文电台 Chinese Radio Seattle, “华州福建工商会举行成立庆典,” 18 Mar 2019, https://chineseradioseattle.com/2019/03/18/wa_fujian_business_association/.

[^125]: As noted above, in 2020, the US Department of State designated the umbrella organization for state and local APCR/US, the Association for China’s Peaceful Unification as a Foreign Mission of the PRC, stating, “The United Front Work Department (UFWD) is the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) organ tasked with co-opting and neutralizing threats to the party’s rule and spreading its influence and propaganda overseas.  The CCP regards this party apparatus as a “magic weapon” to advance Beijing’s policies. Today, the Department of State designated a UFWD-controlled organization – the National Association for China’s Peaceful Unification (NACPU) – as a foreign mission of the PRC under the U.S. Foreign Missions Act.  The goal of this action is to shine a light on this organization and make clear that their messages come from Beijing.” The State Department says, “Authentic people-to-people exchanges are crucial for establishing understanding between cultures, but the UFWD is not a vehicle for people-to-people exchange.  Instead, it uses front organizations like the NACPU to advance the PRC’s propaganda and malign influence.  Our actions today move us a step closer toward a relationship with the PRC based on transparency and reciprocity.” See Michael R. Pompeo, Secretary of State, “Designation of the National Association for China’s Peaceful Unification (NACPU) as a Foreign Mission of the PRC,” US Department of State, 28 Oct 2020, https://2017-2021.state.gov/designation-of-the-national-association-for-chinas-peaceful-unification-nacpu-as-a-foreign-mission-of-the-prc/.

[^127]: The man suspected of carrying out a shooting in a California church attended primarily by people of Taiwanese background on May 15, 2022, was associated with the Las Vegas Association for China’s Peaceful Unification and reportedly attended its founding meeting on April 2, 2019, where he introduced a banner that called for the “eradication of pro-independence demons.” (See Hwang Chun-mei, “California church shooter in Taiwan 'peaceful reunification' group linked to Beijing,” Radio Free Asia, https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/shooter-05172022104957.html) He was charged with 98 counts of federal hate crimes and weapons and explosives offenses, including the murder of one person and attempted murder of 44 others. (See US Department of Justice, “Nevada Man Charged with Federal Hate Crimes for Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian Church Shooting,” 11 May 2023, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nevada-man-charged-federal-hate-crimes-irvine-taiwanese-presbyterian-church-shooting.) It is unclear the extent to which the federal criminal investigation has looked into the suspect’s ties with the Las Vegas ACPU and any role those may have played in the crimes committed or the ties between all ACPUs in the US and the CCP’s China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification.

(See photo: <http://seattle.yeefungtoy.org/2023_Reports_files/2023.04.23-24.png>.) Yee Fung Toy is a clan association dating back to the late nineteenth century in the US. Like other clan associations, it predates the inception of united front groups in the US. When the CCP began its big push to introduce united front influences in the Chinese diaspora, some pre-existing organizations were all but taken over, but clan associations in general are not considered to be  strongly influenced or controlled by united front forces. In Chinese, the character for Yee is the same as that for Yu: 余. The family appears to have originated in southern China and Yee/Yu family associations can be found throughout southeast Asia as well as the US and other countries.
