Xi Jinping took part in APEC meetings held at the Moscone Center, only blocks away from two other locations mentioned frequently in this report, the Hyatt Regency and St Regis. Because there was no event in which Xi was featured, such as the Biden-Xi meeting or the banquet in honor of Xi, no large-scale protests against Xi were called in advance. There were a number of serious incidents of harassment, intimidation and assault. Most occurred in the vicinity of the Moscone Center, and most were against Chinese protesters.

Among the serious incidents of the day were assaults on:
Chinese protester Peng Xiaowei; phone stolen, tracked to Hong Kong, then China
Chinese protester Chen Chuangchuang, pepper-sprayed

Several other reports of assaults appeared in the media and social media, and some were made to us. These shall also be noted in this section.

### Assault on Peng Xiaowei outside Hyatt Regency

The circumstances of the assault on Peng Xiaowei (彭小偉) were similar to those in other situations in which assaults occurred: he was surrounded and outnumbered by CCP supporters. His phone was stolen. This was the first reported theft of a protester’s phone in San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit. There would be several more phone thefts, especially the following day, the 17th, near the airport. This suggests that CCP supporters may have become more aware that photos and videos of them could potentially lead to their identification. Peng believes the assailants were deliberately targeting him for his phone and appeared to be cooperating to steal it. 

Peng was together with two others who held protest signs. Peng was filming, aware of the possibility of attack and wanting evidence. His companions’ placards were snatched away. Then someone behind Peng snatched his phone. He turned around and saw the person who took his phone throw it to someone else who quickly ran away. Peng wanted to pursue him but someone grabbed Peng by his clothes and pulled him back. Four or five others surrounded him and beat him on the head and various parts of his body. Police quickly intervened and removed Peng from the group. His backpack had also disappeared, but police helped him to recover it.[^184]

On November 17, the next day, Peng used the search function on the phone to look for the photos and videos he’d taken, but he discovered that all photos and videos from the 16th had been deleted. The phone’s locator showed that it was in San Francisco.

On November 22, Peng Xiaowei’s sister in the PRC told him that police in their hometown visited her on that date and interrogated her about Peng. Among other questions, they asked her when he had gone to the US, what he was doing there, and when he would return to China. It is possible that the police interrogation was related to the theft of the phone, but Peng Xiaowei is also active on social media and documented his presence in San Francisco on his X/Twitter account, including the attack on him.

Peng said he provided a video of the assault as well as the locations of his phone after its theft to the San Francisco Police Department. As of February 4, 2024, he had received no information from the SFPD regarding the status of the investigation into the incident.[^185] Peng also provided the locations of his phone to the FBI.


### Assault on Chen Chuangchuang, near Moscone Center

Chen Chuangchuang (陳闖創), a lawyer and one of the leaders of the China Democracy Party, was attacked between 12 noon and 1 pm. He said he arrived near the Moscone Center, the APEC venue, along with several other protesters. At the corner of Fourth and Mission Streets, they found themselves outnumbered by CCP supporters. 

The attack occurred during a confrontation between CCP supporters and protesters. CCP supporters were pushing protesters away from the temporary security fence put up in front of the Moscone Center, and thus, away from view from the center. They cornered some of the protesters in the entryway of a building. At that point, police intervened and attempted to separate the parties. As they were doing so, Chen was pepper-sprayed in the face by a CCP supporter. Chen’s glasses had been broken by CCP supporters the day before, the 15th, and when he was pepper-sprayed, he didn’t even realize at first what had happened until his eyes started burning.[^186]


<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KWx5tUFSCsYaIp-4HiiYJj4FrP4lbBim/preview" class="sm:w-full lg:w-2/3 h-2/3 sm:h-80" allow="autoplay">[^187]</iframe>

This is the person Chen identified as the perpetrator of the pepper-spray attack.

 <img src="/images/Screen-Shot-2024-04-12-at-6.40.58-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2024-04-12 at 6.40.58 PM" class="w-1/3"/>

 The actual moment when Chen was pepper-sprayed cannot itself be seen in the above video. But seconds before the attack occurs, the bluish green shirt of another man can be seen close to Chen. The man can also be seen at other points in the video:

 <img src="/images/Joe-Ma-Zuolin-馬作林-at-scene.png" alt="Joe Ma Zuolin 馬作林 at scene" class="w-1/3"/>

 His name is Joe Ma Zuolin (馬作林). On his belt in the above still he wears an empty holster which could be used to hold a can of pepper spray. He is the prominent chairman of the East Bay Toishan Association (東灣台山同鄉會; also sometimes called the Toishan Benevolent Association in English) based in nearby Oakland. Ironically, one of his most publicized initiatives in recent years was a Chinatown Patrol Team, which sought to reduce crime in Oakland’s Chinatown and was associated in the media with countering anti-Asian hate crimes, yet here he was on the streets of San Francisco across the bay involved with a group that was carrying out attacks against other Asians.[^189]

The man whom Chen identified as the person who pepper-sprayed him is apparently an associate of Ma. He appeared with him at an event held in January 2024 with the purpose of improving relations betweens Oakland’s Black and Asian communities.[^190] The man appears to be regularly involved with the East Bay Toishan Association, as he appeared in its Lunar New Year events in 2019, 2020, and 2023.[^191]

The East Bay Toishan Association has had a cordial relationship with the PRC consulate of San Francisco and appears to align itself with CCP priorities. Wang Kun (王昆), an official at the consulate (as of 2023, Deputy Director of Overseas Chinese Affairs[^192]), spoke at the East Bay Toishan Association’s 22nd and 23rd anniversary celebrations in 2023 and 2024 and praised the association for its collaboration with “patriotic overseas groups.” He also noted that the association’s founding mission includes “supporting the motherland’s development” and “working toward China’s unification.”[^193] In 2022, members of the association, including Joe Ma, celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the PRC.[^194] The association displayed the PRC flag alongside the US flag, a visual element frequently seen among CCP supporters in San Francisco and among united front groups in general.[^195]

In the above video of the assault, as Chen pleads with the police to arrest the man he identified as the culprit and says he wants to file a police report, his companions suddenly see the alleged culprit in the crowd and rush toward him (1:42). At this point, CCP supporters intercede, stepping between the culprit and the onrushing protesters followed by the police. The culprit can just barely be seen in the left-hand side of the video around 1:50:

 <img src="/images/Chen-Chuangchuang-assailant-in-RFA-video.png" alt="Chen Chuangchuang assailant in RFA video" class="w-1/3"/>

As fellow CCP supporters stand between him and Chen’s companions, the suspect recedes into the background. Among those blocking the approach to him are Chen Wenshen (陳文深, the bald-headed man entering the video frame at 1’52”). 

 <img src="/images/At-ChenChuangchuang-attack-6nov23-Moscone-Center.png" alt="At ChenChuangchuang attack 16nov23 Moscone Center" class="w-1/2"/>

As noted previously, Chen Wenshen was at the scene of several attacks. Indeed, he was last seen on the evening of November 15 near the Hyatt Regency playing the same role he played on this occasion, preventing protesters from following the person they believed to be the culprit. (See above.) Earlier in the video (00:17), he can be seen aggressively going after a man holding an “End CCP” placard and attempting to snatch it from him.

Another person blocking the approach to the man accused of pepper-spraying Chen is Guo Jianwei (郭建伟, seen standing next to Chen Wenshen on his left side at 1:57):


<div class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-3 pt-5">

</div>

Like Chen, Guo was involved in the attack on Wang Wei on the 15th, throwing a punch at him as he lay on the ground. (See above.)

The below photo shows Chen Chuangchuang making a report to the police after the attack. As of January 31, 2024, Chen had received no information from the San Francisco Police Department about the status of the investigation into the attack.[^196]

<img src="/images/Screen-Shot-2024-04-12-at-6.53.59-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2024-04-12 at 6.53.59 PM" class="w-1/2"/>[^197]

Three Chinese protesters and a non-Asian passerby were assaulted outside the Moscone Center, not far from where Chen Chuangchaung was pepper-sprayed. The three Chinese protesters were Liu Yijiang, Jiao Ruilin and Hu Tingfeng. The passerby attempted to intervene to protect the protesters under attack. He was hit over the head with a glass bottle. There was significant bleeding, and the inch-and-a-half-long cut required stitches at the hospital later.[^198]

One of the CCP supporters present at the scene, an older man, was identified by victims as having a role in the attacks, perhaps directing the others.

<img src="/images/suspected-organizer-(Liu-Yijiang).png" alt="suspected organizer (Liu Yijiang)" class="w-1/2"/>

The man is Zhu Jiemei (朱介眉), a united front leader from the Portland, Oregon area, reported to be chair of the Oregon Overseas Chinese Association (俄勒岡華人聯合會), vice-chair (or in some cases, vice-president) of the US Association for China’s Peaceful Unification (美洲和平統一促進聯合會), and chair of the US Suey Sing Association (美洲萃勝工商會波特蘭, a traditional chamber of commerce dating back to the early days of Chinese immigrant presence in the US), all of the above according to the Shaanxi Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese (陝西省歸國華僑聯合會), a United Front group in Shaanxi province, PRC, in a report it made about Zhu’s April 2023 visit to Shaanxi.[^199] The source of the report is a sign that the visit was official and made in coordination with Party authorities. On that visit, he wore the same black fedora hat he wore in San Francisco. Other sources refer to him as chair of the Oregon Association for China’s Peaceful Reunification (俄勒岡州促進中國統一促進會)[^200], and founding member ( 元老) of the Portland Suey Sing Chamber of Labor & Commerce (砵崙萃勝工商会).[^201]

Zhu was also present at the August 2023 pro-CCP demonstration in San Francisco against the visit of then-Taiwan Vice-President William Lai Ching-te[^202]. The RFA article in which he is quoted refers to Zhu as the chair of the Oregon Overseas Chinese Association. Several local Associations for the Peaceful Reunification of China were present at the demonstration, including the one from Oregon he has been reported to chair. Jing Dongsheng (靖東升), another united front leader from Portland, also appeared at that August 2023 protest, and appeared on the streets of San Francisco participating in the harassment and intimidation of Li Huanjun and apparently acting as a scout. (See above.) 

In September 2023, Zhu gave a speech at an event celebrating the 74th anniversary of the PRC that was attended by top officials of the PRC consulate in San Francisco.[^203] In March 2019, he also gave a speech at an event celebrating 40 years of “Reform and Opening.” That was also attended by top officials of the PRC consulate in San Francisco as well as Jing Dongsheng. 

Zhu was also pictured holding a PRC flag on the corner of Third and Jessie Streets, across from the Hyatt Regency along with Jing Dongsheng and Yu Yingqiang, the man who attacked the 74-year-old Hong Kong protester on the 15th. (See above.)

![Yu Yingqiang w Jing Dongsheng at 3rd & Jessie 15 nov 23](/images/Yu-Yingqiang-w-Jing-Dongsheng-at-3rd-&-Jessie-15-nov-23.png) 

Another united front figure from the Portland area, Rong Junwu (容鈞武), was also on the scene, dressed in a white jacket.

He was also present at the assault on Wang Wei on the 15th and as one of the scouts along with Jing Dongsheng and Yu Yingqiang in Ma Yongtian’s video. (See above.) He also attended the April 2023 protest against Taiwan president Tsai Ing-wen’s visit to Los Angeles, along with Jing Dongsheng, He Konghua and Chen Zhaojin.[^205] Rong Junwu is associated with the Portland Suey Sing Chamber of Commerce & Industry, acting as its vice-president and consultant in 2022, president in 2023, and consultant in 2024.[^206]

</div>

The bald-headed Chen Wenshen (陳文深) was also present during the attacks at the Moscone Center, as he had been just a short time before when Chen Chuangchuang was pepper-sprayed as well as on other occasions including the assault on Wang Wei near the St Regis on the 15th, near the barricade attack on Tibetan and Hong Kong protesters near the Hyatt Regency on the 15th (see above), and at the airport on the 17th (see below). 

<div class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-3 pt-5">

    <img src="/images/Chen Wenshen Moscone Center 16nov23-min.png" alt="Chen Wenshen Moscone Center 16nov23" class="w-full"/>
</div>

Liu Yijiang also identified Liu Baohai (劉寶海) (left) and the man standing next to him as involved in the attacks.

<img src="/images/Liu-Baohai-and-one-other.jpeg" alt="Liu Baohai and one other.jpeg" class="w-1/2"/>

Liu Baohai was also involved in the attack on Tibetan protesters at the designated protest zone across from the Hyatt Regency on the 15th and has been seen at other pro-CCP events in the past. (See above.)

Prior to the attacks on Chinese protesters near the Moscone Center, a group of Vietnamese protesters had been gathered at the same location. Some members of the China Democracy Party joined them. One of the Vietnamese protesters had a placard depicting Xi Jinping. This excited the wrath of the CCP supporters who began attacking the Vietnamese protesters. In fact, the Vietnamese protesters had been on the scene first, along with a handful of Chinese protesters, and the CCP supporters attempted to supplant them, mixing in with them and covering their flags and posters with PRC flags. Liu Baohai was also involved in that incident.

A united front leader from San Francisco was also present during the harassment and intimidation of the Vietnamese and Chinese protesters. Her name is Jennifer Cheung/Chung (張藍真/張蘭真; also sometimes referred to in pinyin as Zhang Lanzhen). She can also be seen in the above video. Below she holds a long flagpole with a PRC flag on it, pointing it toward the protesters in a threatening manner:

<img src="/images/Jennifer-Cheung-Moscone-Center-16nov23-3.png" alt="Jennifer Cheung Moscone Center 16nov23 3" class="w-1/2"/>

Cheung is chair of the Rape of Nanking Redress Coalition (南京大屠殺索賠聯盟)[^208] and President of the Global Alliance for Preserving the History of WWII in Asia (世界抗日戰爭史實維護聯合會; the literal translation is “Global Alliance for Safeguarding the Historical Truth of the Anti-Japan War”), the latter as reported on the Alliance for China’s Peaceful Reunification website.[^209]

On the 17th, she was at the San Francisco International Airport, where she played a key role. (See below for more on that and other information about her united front activities and network.)

Both Chen Wenshen and Jennifer Cheung can be seen briefly in a video of the assault on Hu Tingfeng (with the assaults on Liu Yijiang and Jiao Ruilin occurring nearby). The following are screenshots from the video.

Chen in particular appears to have actively participated in the assault. 

Chinese protester Li Delong (李德龍) was attacked near the Moscone Center. He said he was knocked unconscious, his head and mouth were bleeding, he was sent to the hospital by ambulance for treatment, and he filed a report with the San Francisco Police Department on November 21.[^211]

Other assaults on November 16 were reported in the media or on social media, including the following. Chinese protester He Ruizhong (賀瑞忠) reported being beaten by several security guards working with CCP supporters on the sidewalk outside Oren’s Hummus restaurant across the street from the Hyatt Regency.[^212] Chinese protester Ge Kaiying (葛開英) reported being attacked around noon around Fourth Street near the Moscone Center. She said the attacker stepped on her feet, stole a box she was carrying and then hit her. She identified the attacker as Li Huahong, the head of the Chinese Anti-Cult World Alliance who was also involved in the assault on Jia Junwei near the St Regis on the 14th and the attack on the designated protest area across the street from the Hyatt Regency on the 15th.[^213] (See above) A Chinese protester named Victor Yuen as well as Chinese protester Chen Weiming (陳維明) reported the beating of another China Democracy Party member who was taken to an ambulance for treatment. This occurred near the Hyatt Regency.[^214]
