This report is based primarily on the testimonies of 26 protesters and one journalist who were present in San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit from November 14 to 17, 2023, as well as on video and photographic evidence provided by protesters. Media reports and social media posts have also been of some assistance. 

We have attempted to document all cases of harassment and intimidation of and assault on protesters that we came across. All cases described in detail have been substantiated by testimonies of participants and witnesses and/or video and photographic evidence. 

We have attempted to identify those involved in attacks on protesters through the use of open-source research and facial recognition technology. 

We have identified some groups and individuals as belonging to the Chinese Communist Party’s “united front,” meaning that evidence was found indicating that they have associated with Party organs and/or officials and/or representatives of the People’s Republic of China, and have taken actions aligned with the Party’s agenda. In most cases that evidence was found in reporting by Chinese-language media and on websites of Party organs or united front groups.

We have attempted to contact all of those identified in the report as CCP supporters as well as private security firms perceived to be associated with CCP supporters through email, telephone calls and letters. We notified them that they are mentioned in the report, asked if we might ask them some questions, and offered them the opportunity to respond and comment. As of May 15, 2024, most have not responded. None has responded affirmatively. In many cases, these groups and individuals have little to no online presence or website. Many of the email addresses and phone numbers they have made available online or in tax documents proved to be incorrect, out of date, or inoperative. In the first instance, we contacted them by telephone or email at the numbers and addresses that could be found. Where that did not succeed, and in cases where post addresses could be found, we sent letters to them. Only two could be reached by phone. Both made clear they did not wish to speak with us. One responded to email inquiries. None responded to letters.Of those identified in the report as being present on the streets of San Francisco during Xi’s visit, we have not been able to find contact information for three leaders of united front groups, one CCP member based in the PRC, and one convicted felon with no known united front leadership position.

We have also reached out to the San Francisco Police Department, the South San Francisco Police Department, and the San Mateo Sheriff’s Office for information and comment.. 

Where we have received responses, we have included those in the report.
