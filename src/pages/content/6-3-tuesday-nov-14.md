(First day of Xi’s Visit to San Francisco)

Xi Jinping arrived at the San Francisco International Airport. He and the Chinese delegation were rumored to be staying at the St Regis hotel. Hundreds of C.C.P. supporters lined the route from the airport to the hotel and also gathered near the hotel. Some protesters also went to the airport. A few were present along the route of Xi’s motorcade. A few more were near the hotel. The first incidents of harassment, intimidation and assault occurred on this day.

Among the serious incidents of the day were:
The harassment and intimidation of Uyghur camp survivor Tursunay Ziyawudun and other Uyghurs at the San Francisco International Airport
The harassment and intimidation of Chinese activist Li Huanjun on the route from the airport to the St Regis
The assault on Chinese activist Jia Junwei outside the St Regis

### Near San Francisco International Airport
Beginning in the morning, both CCP supporters and protesters gathered along the airport access road in anticipation of Xi’s arrival. They remained there until shortly after 3 pm when Xi was reported to have arrived. Many of the CCP supporters on the airport access road on the 14th appeared to be students, presumably recruited through CSSAs.[^63]

Elements appeared — intimidation by numbers and utilization of flags and flagpoles — that would become familiar in subsequent days. In particular, CCP supporters used their superior numbers to hound and crowd out protesters, attempting to block or obscure both protesters and their banners and flags from the road. Unmarked white trucks delivered massive flagpoles and PRC flags to the CCP supporters.[^64] While at first glance, use of flags and flagpoles may seem relatively mild as a form of repression, flags and flagpoles were consistently singled out by protesters interviewed for this report as among the items most frequently used to harass, intimidate, and assault. The flags were often enormously large and used to cover protesters, both so that their protest could not be seen and so that assailants could not be seen attacking them. The flagpoles were used to hit and stab protesters. PRC flags and flagpoles appear to have been CCP supporters’ weapons of choice throughout Xi Jinping’s visit, presumably because their dual purpose provided a cloak of plausible deniability. 

Topjor Tsultrim, Communications Coordinator at Students for a Free Tibet, reported that CCP supporters near the airport pushed into areas where protesters were gathered and surrounded them, apparently at the direction of their leaders or organizers. The CCP supporters attempted to unfurl a large banner in front of the protesters, so as to block view of them from the road where Xi was expected to pass. They yelled at the protesters and blared megaphones in their faces.

They did not chant slogans; they just had pre-recorded chants and patriotic songs blaring on a loop out of loudspeakers. They persistently tried to drape their flags over the protesters.[^65]

Security guards on the side of the CCP supporters placed themselves in between the CCP supporters and the protesters and asserted, “This is our space,” “our” clearly referring to the CCP supporters’. This was the first appearance of security guards. They would be seen wherever CCP supporters appeared in the coming days. They were dressed in all-black suits. (Other security guards employed by another firm would also be seen working for the CCP supporters at another location this same day.) One news report interviewed a security guard who was said to work for the Chinese consulate at the scene of confrontations between protesters and CCP supporters.[^66] Lu Qiang, the united front leader from southern California, told a Chinese-language publication that he had hired security guards.[^67]

The security guards in all-black suits were employed by a firm called Critical Synthesis Security, apparently based in San Francisco. Several protesters were confused by their role in the streets during Xi Jinping’s visit. The guards themselves appeared at times confused about what their role was, or unenthusiastic about it, according to the reports of several protesters. Some protesters said some guards appeared to assert authority that went beyond anything they could conceivably be legally entitled to.

Another pattern seen at the airport that would recur in subsequent days is that while protesters were happy and often eager to speak with journalists, CCP supporters more often than not declined to do so and were media-shy. They often appeared uncomfortable with answering questions about their reasons for being at a public demonstration. Almost all reports that exist in which views of and information about CCP supporters are presented are in Chinese-language media with a pro-CCP slant.[^70]

### Harassment and intimidation of Uyghur camp survivor Tursunay Ziyawudun and other Uyghurs
Of particular note is the harassment of Uyghur camp survivor Tursunay Ziyawadun and other Uyghurs.[^71] CCP supporters attempted to surround her and use PRC flags to cover the flag of East Turkestan she carried. 

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1clRVv3CreSVr43cyNJ8ovv4bLKsOQoNq/preview" class="sm:w-full lg:w-1/2 h-80 " allow="autoplay"></iframe>

The episode is redolent with ironic symbolism: having escaped from both a CCP concentration camp for Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims and a CCP-ruled East Turkestan, Tursunay found herself harassed once again by people loyal to the regime that had persecuted her, but this time on American soil. The CCP supporters who harassed her most likely had no idea of who she was or what she had been through. The feeling that they had come to the US to escape persecution at the hands of PRC authorities and now here they were experiencing it again in the US was a sentiment shared by many of the protesters in San Francisco, who were originally from China, East Turkestan, Hong Kong and Tibet.

<u> **On the route from the San Francisco International Airport to the St Regis Hotel**</u>

Along the route from the San Francisco International Airport to St Regis Hotel, where the Chinese delegation was rumored to be staying, many CCP supporters awaited Xi’s motorcade to pass as well as some protesters. 

### Harassment and intimidation of Li Huanjun

One protester in particular posted a video of herself being harassed and intimidated in the afternoon of November 14 along the route.[^72] Her name is Li Huanjun (李煥君).

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BweZVqVNTmusdaAafuiv_2KKQXxOPnow/preview"  allow="autoplay" class="sm:w-full lg:w-1/2 h-80 "> [^73]</iframe>

Li Huanjun’s family were victims of forced demolition in the PRC. After years of advocating on their behalf and suffering persecution, Li went into exile.[^74] She had blocked Xi’s motorcade on two of his previous visits to the US.[^75]

In the video, Li Huanjun is jostled by CCP supporters. They repeatedly hold a large PRC flag in front of her so that she cannot be seen from the road. Whenever she attempts to get away from them, they follow her and continue to hold the flag in front of her. Near the end of the video, she is hit in the head with a flagpole. She says she was also pinched in the arms, waist and other places multiple times.[^76]

There is the already-familiar pattern of flags being used to obscure protesters, flagpoles being used as weapons, and the repeated jostling and pinching.

Several elements of united front operations as well as united front figures can be seen in this video. For that reason, it is worth dwelling on in some detail. 
Near the end of the video (01:27), a man with a mohawk appears from behind the flag. He is one of the people who jostled and covered Li Huanjun.


![Chen LongkuiM](/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-08-at-1.05.01-PM.png)  
His name is Chen Longkui (陳隆魁). According to articles in Chinese-language pro-CCP publications, based on information provided by an official at the United Front Work Department of Guilin city, Chen comes from Guilin in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the PRC and came to the US to study in the 1980s, later settling there. As of September 2023, he was president of the Guilin Qiaozi Enterprise Federation (桂林僑資企業聯合會), board chair of the Guangxi Tourism Development Group (廣西景區通旅遊發展有限公司), and an overseas committee member of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese (中國僑聯/中華全國歸國華僑聯合會/AFROC). AFROC is the same organization to which Lu Qiang (see above) belongs, the top-level United Front group with overall responsibility for overseeing relations with overseas Chinese.[^77] In fact, he attended the same event as Lu, the 11th National Congress of Returned Overseas Chinese in September 2023, just two months before Xi Jinping’s trip to San Francisco. He posed for a photo in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. Xi Jinping and other top CCP officials addressed the Congress.[^78]

The large man who played the most prominent role in the harassment and intimidation of Li Huanjun is another united front leader.

<img src="images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-08-at-12.53.53-PM.png" alt="2024-02-08-t12-53pm"  class="w-1/2" />

His name is Jing Dongsheng (靖東升). He is reported to be the president of the united front group, Oregon Association for the Promotion of the Peaceful Unification of China (俄勒岡州中國統一促進會)[^79] as well as Executive Chairman of the Oregon National Day Organizing Committee (俄勒岡州國慶籌委會),[^80] and Honorary Chairman of the American Chinese United Association Oregon Chapter (美華總會俄勒岡州分會). Associations for China’s “peaceful unification” are prototypical united front groups affiliated with the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification, which was set up by the United Front Work Department. In November 2019, Jing hosted a delegation from the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification led by its Deputy Secretary-General Sun Lingyan (孫凌雁), a meeting reported on by the Alliance for China’s Peaceful Reunification, USA.[^81] In August 2022, he hosted a banquet to welcome Zhang Jianmin, the Consul General of the PRC consulate in San Francisco (中國駐舊金山總領事張建敏) to Oregon.[^82]

In addition to having participated in the harassment and intimidation of Li Huanjun, Jing Dongsheng appears also to have been a “scout,” one of the people apparently stationed at various “sensitive” locations where Xi’s delegation stayed at or was expected to appear around San Francisco to keep a lookout for protesters. He appears in this video posted by Ma Yongtian (馬永田), photographing her with his camera in a taunting manner.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/19xMEBMyUNXnEgnDZ4fGomsRXhdjnrnk0/preview" class="sm:w-full lg:w-1/2 h-80 " allow="autoplay"></iframe>[^83]

Ma is from Jilin province. Her factory was forcibly seized in 2001, and since then, she has been seeking compensation. She was arrested in 2017 in Florida for blocking Xi Jinping’s motorcade.[^84] In San Francisco, she was searching for a place where she might do the same when she came across these scouts. Not only is Jing Dongsheng present; so are other recognizable united front figures. Two of them appear together with him in the same frame:

<img src="images/Ma-Yongtian-video-2.png" alt="Ma Yongtian video 2-min" class="w-full "/>

Both of them were seen elsewhere on the streets of San Francisco. One is named Yu Yingqiang (余穎強). He was seen acting as a lookout near the Hyatt Regency Hotel on November 15 and was among the crowd of CCP supporters that assaulted Tibetan protester Chemi Lhamo near the airport on November 17. On the evening of November 15, he assaulted an elderly Hong Kong protester near the Hyatt Regency hotel where a banquet for Xi Jinping was being held. (See below for details.) The other man is Rong Junwu (容鈞武). He was also part of a group of CCP supporters that assaulted several Chinese protesters near the Moscone Center on November 16 and at the San Francisco International Airport on November 17. (See below for details.)

<img src="/images/At-ChenChuangchuang-attack-6nov23-Moscone-Center.png" alt="At ChenChuangchuang attack 16nov23 Moscone Center"/>
</div>

Both men appear to be, like Jing Dongsheng, from the Portland, Oregon area.[^85]

Jing Dongsheng has also been seen at united front street demonstrations on other occasions. In March 2023, he was among CCP supporters protesting against Taiwan’s then-President Tsai Ing-wen’s visit to Los Angeles. There he can be seen with two other known united front figures, He Konghua (何孔華) and Chen Zhaojin (陳兆進), both of whom appeared in San Francisco (see below for information about their activities in San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit), as well as the unidentified man with whom Ma Yongtian found Jing scouting. 


<img  src="/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-02-at-2.31.52-PM-min.png" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-02 at 2.31.52 PM" />

The woman in sunglasses with a megaphone is He Konghua, a united front figure in San Francisco. The man to her left in the white jacket is Rong Junwu (容鈞武), who was scouting and also part of the group that assaulted Chinese protesters in San Francisco where he wore the same white jacket. The man to his left is Jing Dongsheng, and the man holding a phone behind He Konghua is Chen Zhaojin, another united front figure from San Francisco. Newsweek reported that the pro-CCP demonstrators against Tsai were offered $400 each for each day of the protest by Deputy Consul Li Chunlin of the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles.[^86]

Jing Dongsheng also attended a united front protest against Taiwan then-Vice-President William Lai Ching-te’s visit to San Francisco in August 2023.[^87] Another united front figure, Liu Baohai (劉寶海) also attended. Liu would later be seen on November 15 among a group attacking Tibetan protesters outside the Hyatt Regency hotel. (See below.)

The other scouts in Ma Yongtian’s video are men dressed in similar black tracksuits. 

<div class="grid  sm:grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2">
<img src="/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-08-at-11.24.09-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-08 at 11.24.09 AM" />

</div>

Men in black tracksuits were spotted repeatedly conducting similar scouting activities in the downtown San Francisco area during Xi Jinping’s visit.

<img  src="/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-07-at-1.01.59-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-07 at 1.01.59 PM" class="w-1/2"/>

Several protesters suspected that these men had been assigned to look out and report for “troublemakers.”

They did not always restrict themselves to scouting alone. Circling back to the video of the harassment and intimidation of Li Huanjun, a man in a black tracksuit top is holding the flag being used to cover Li.

<img  src="/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-08-at-12.53.08-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-08 at 12.53.08 PM" class=" sm:w-full lg:w-1/2"/>

He turned and looked at Li (who was holding the camera):
<img  src="/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-08-at-12.59.55-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-08 at 12.59.55 PM" class=" sm:w-full lg:w-1/2"/>

Also in that video, security guards can be seen cooperating with the CCP supporters. A group of security guards links hands with one another to prevent Li Huanjun from approaching the street. 

<img  src="/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-08-at-12.57.32-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-08 at 12.57.32 PM" class=""/>

Judging by their uniforms and shoulder badges, these security guards work for a different company than those from Critical Synthesis who dressed in black suits and could be seen at many incidents of harassment, intimidation and assault on protesters on all days of Xi Jinping’s visit to San Francisco. These guards appear younger and wear the shoulder badge of National Protective Service Private Security, a group that advertises itself as working in the San Francisco Bay Area.[^88]

As in several other incidents of harassment, intimidation and assault of protesters by CCP supporters, rather than intervene to protect the victim, the security guards assisted the perpetrators.

<u>**Near St Regis (125 3rd St, San Francisco)**</u>
St Regis San Francisco hotel is where Xi Jinping and the PRC delegation were reported to stay. For that reason, it attracted both CCP supporters and protesters. 

Xi Jinping was reported to touch down at San Francisco airport at 2:30 pm, and Xi was reported to arrive at the St Regis around 3:30 or 4 pm on November 14.[^89]

Trouble outside the hotel began earlier that afternoon. Large numbers of one CCP united front group, American Chinese Commerce Association (Hong Kong) (ACCA (HK), 美國(香港)旅美華人總商會) , as well as members of another united front group, Chinese Anti-Cult World Alliance (全球華人反邪教聯盟), were present. The chair of ACCA (HK), John Chen Shanzhuang, the united front leader profiled earlier in this report who organized the transport of many from New York, was present.[^90] CCP supporters blared the PRC national anthem on a loop on loudspeakers and attempted to outshout and sometimes surround the protesters present with PRC flags.[^91] Most of the protesters were effectively harassed out of the area by Xi’s supporters.

**Assault on Jia Junwei**  
Around this time, the first outright assault during Xi Jinping’s visit occurred. A female protester named Jia Junwei (賈俊偉) was attacked by a group of CCP supporters in the vicinity of the St Regis. Jia said she was protesting because her home in the PRC was demolished by corrupt elements (腐敗分子) and her father was imprisoned and “persecuted to death” in custody. She held up a self-made banner that told this story.

Jia said that a CCP supporter named Li Huahong snatched her banner, dragged her into an area surrounded by other CCP supporters who held up their large PRC flags so that no one could see what was happening, pulled her hair, and hit her head. She lost consciousness but could still feel that she was being hit in the head by what felt like flagpoles. She believed this was done to her because Xi Jinping’s motorcade was expected to arrive at the hotel and the attackers didn’t want Xi to see her. Jia also believed the CCP supporters were ordered by members of the Chinese Embassy to attack her. People she believed to be members at the Chinese Embassy first took photos of her, then pointed and gestured at her. It was only after they pointed and gestured at her that people with the PRC flags came over and surrounded her. The apparent leader of the attack, Li Huahong, wore an earpiece and headphones and carried a loudspeaker. After Jia was attacked, an ambulance came to the scene and first responders attended to her.[^92]

In these photos, the CCP supporters can be seen surrounding Jia and attempting to block view of her with PRC flags.
<div class="grid  sm:grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2">
<img  src="/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-08-at-12.21.54-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-08 at 12.21.54 PM" class=""/>
<img  src="/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-08-at-12.21.30-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-08 at 12.21.30 PM" class=""/>
</div>

In the following photo, CCP supporters have taken Jia’s banner and are surrounding her. Jia is the one wearing the black backpack and gray pants. Strikingly, a police officer stands in a position from which he should have a view of what is occurring but does nothing to intervene.  

<img  src="/images/attack-on-Jia-Junwei-14nov23-St-Regis-希望之聲.png" alt="attack on Jia Junwei 14nov23 St Regis 希望之聲" class=" sm:w-full lg:w-1/2"/>
Only after Jia has been knocked to the ground unconscious does a police officer come to her aid. 

<img  src="/images/Jia-Junwei-on-ground-13nov23-希望之聲.png" alt="aJia Junwei on ground 13nov23 希望之聲 " class=" sm:w-full lg:w-1/2"/>

Six elements of this attack fit a pattern seen repeatedly over the days of Xi Jinping’s visit: 
1. an attack on solitary and isolated protesters by a group of CCP supporters, 
2. swarming of victim by multiple CCP supporters, 
3. use of PRC flags to obscure the attacks, 
4. use of flagpoles as weapons to hit and stab protesters; 
5. heightened aggression and violence when Xi Jinping is believed to be in the vicinity, so as to ensure that he cannot see any signs of protest, and 
6. an apparent leader, often wearing an earpiece, who appears to be directing the CCP supporters.

After the attack, Jia said she was nauseous, had no appetite, and felt like vomiting. She later went to Los Angeles where she visited a hospital and was diagnosed with symptoms “consistent with a concussion.” She was issued concussion discharge instructions and prescribed medication.[^93]

Li Huahong, prominent leader of united front group and alleged assailant

The person whom Jia Junwei identified as her main attacker was Li Huahong (李華紅). Jia says Li snatched her banner, dragged her into the encirclement of PRC flags, pulled her hair, and hit her in the head. After Jia fell to the ground, Li kicked her in the waist. Li was the apparent leader of the attack. She wore an earpiece and headphones and held a loudspeaker.[^94] She is the woman in the above photo with the white megaphone strapped to her shoulder.

Li was involved in other attacks in subsequent days. On November 15 outside the Hyatt Regency Hotel where a banquet was held in Xi Jinping’s honor, she was among a group of CCP supporters who attacked protesters.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m-SscXXlJeR0XxUtfOAN9eLvSzk_sNE8/preview" class="sm:w-full lg:w-1/2 h-80 " allow="autoplay"></iframe>

On November 16, female protester Ge Kaiying (葛開英) reports that she was attacked by Li Huahong at noon on Fourth Street in downtown San Francisco. She was alone and said Li recognized her from previous days when she was protesting. According to Ge, Li stepped on her feet, then grabbed a box from Ge. When Ge tried to find her belongings, Li hit her.[^95]

On November 16, China Democracy Party leader and protester Chen Chuangchuang (陳闖創) was pepper-sprayed in the face by an assailant who suddenly rushed at him. (See below.) Right before the incident, Chen had noticed Li Huahong, whom he recognized because they both live in Chinese communities in New York City. 

Chen reports that on November 15, Li was chatting with someone from his group, though she did not know that person was a protester. She told him that she was paid about $200 a day to be in San Francisco and after “welcoming Xi” on November 14 was treated to a lobster dinner.[^96]

Li Huahong is a prominent united front figure. Since the founding of Chinese Anti-Cult World Alliance (全球華人反邪教聯盟, CACWA), Li has represented herself as its chairperson.[^97] According to its mission statement in its Certificate of Incorporation in New York State, as a not-for-profit corporation, CACWA is dedicated to “expos[ing] Falun Gong as an evil and dangerous threat to society.” CACWA is a branch office or affiliate organization of the China Anti-Cult Association (中國反邪教協會, CACA). CACA is officially a private organization in the PRC, but it “has close ties with the CCP and is generally perceived as part of its apparatus.[^98]

CACA has created branch offices or affiliate organizations such as CACWA around the world to conduct “comprehensive suppression overseas.” 

According to the Human Rights Law Foundation, “CACWA’s chairpersons and affiliates have…been implicated in numerous instances of violence, death threats, and property destruction targeting Falun Gong practitioners….”[^99]

Both Li and other members of CACWA were convicted in 2013 of assaulting Falun Gong practitioners and people they suspected of being associated with Falun Gong in 2011 in New York City.[^100]
 
Li Huahong was wearing a CACWA vest when she assaulted Jia Junwei on November 14. (See above photo.) A man wearing a CACWA jacket was part of a group that attacked Tibetan protesters inside a parking garage across from the Hyatt Regency Hotel on November 15.

Additional information on Jing Dingsheng: Jing also appeared at a united front event held in the Seattle area on March 16, 2019 to celebrate the founding of the Washington Fujian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (WFCCI) (华州福建工商会). Deputy Consul General Zou Yonghong and Consul Chen Di of the Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco attended the meeting to congratulate the organization on its founding. A message was read out from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office (OCAO) of Fujian Province. OCAO is an external name for the CCP’s United Front Work Department. The vice-president of WFCCI, Chen Wenshen (陈文深), was also present at that event. To many protesters in San Francisco, Chen wass recognizable as the bald-headed man who appeared at many incidents of intimidation, harassment and assault during Xi Jinping’s visit.
