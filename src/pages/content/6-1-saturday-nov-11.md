## (three days before Xi’s arrival in San Francisco)
Threats against activists were made even before Xi Jinping’s arrival on November 14.

### Threat against Yao Cheng
At least one Chinese activist residing in the United States, Yao Cheng (姚誠), reported that on November 10, his daughter was summoned to a Ministry of Public Security office in Anhui province and told to tell him not to go to San Francisco to participate in protests. Yao’s message to the Anhui PSB was, “You inviting her to tea [a common euphemism for interrogation] is actually a threat to me.”[^24]



### Threats against Uyghurs
Uyghurs also reported cases of Uyghurs in East Turkestan and/or the PRC being contacted by PRC authorities and told to tell their relatives living in the United States not to attend any protests against Xi Jinping in San Francisco. A Uyghur leader in the US has confirmed these cases but has said that the Uyghurs in the US whose families were contacted in the PRC do not wish to go on the record about the incidents. The use of families in the PRC/East Turkestan to convey threats to Uyghurs in the diaspora is a well-documented tactic of the CCP.[^25]

### Threats against Anna Kwok
On the morning of November 11, Hong Kong Democracy Council Executive Director Anna Kwok announced on social media that she had arrived in San Francisco and was going to protest against Xi Jinping.

### Threats against Anna Kwok
On the morning of November 11, Hong Kong Democracy Council Executive Director Anna Kwok announced on social media that she had arrived in San Francisco and was going to protest against Xi Jinping.[^26]
In response, about twelve hours later, she was inundated with online threats. Some encouraged others to apprehend her. Others threatened kidnapping her. One said, “Can somebody drop her unconscious body at the Chinese consulate/embassy?”[^27] The threats, all made from what appear to be pseudonymous accounts, appeared to be coordinated. The accounts shared and commented on each other’s comments. Many used the same image, her face on the Hong Kong Police Force’s wanted poster which offered a bounty of HK$1 million for information or assistance leading to her arrest. The US Department of State (see above) and governmental authorities in other countries had already denounced the arrest warrants and bounties against Hong Kong activists in exile as transnational repression.

Kwok said, “All the comments appeared at once. Most of the comments encouraged others to act on the arrest warrant and bounty and hunt me down; they didn’t say they’d do it themselves. They sought to rile up lone wolf patriots who would be mad enough to do it. That way, [those who made the posts on social media] wouldn’t have to pay the legal consequences themselves. It was the same group of 10 or so accounts making the threats. I assume they were coordinated and instructed.”[^29]

She reported the threats to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the morning of November 12, sending screenshots of the threats. On November 14, an FBI agent at its San Francisco office contacted her. She was told to call 911 if she faced any life-threatening event. The agent told her that the FBI had contacted relevant authorities in San Francisco about the incident and provided San Francisco Police Department precincts with her name and photo.[^30]

In the subsequent days, Kwok said, “There were multiple moments when I knew others were threatened and harassed. When I reached out to the FBI, likely because I was the one who had well-documented threats prior to the occasion, I was the ‘person of interest’ in the system. In other words, the process catered more toward my safety and well-being instead of protecting all protesters on site. When asked about actions they could take, the options are limited. The FBI could not intervene in the on-site command chain of local law enforcement. When I spoke to the police on site, they were not equipped with knowledge of the situation; nor did they understand that this was transnational repression happening before their eyes. Some of them were even unaware of the fact that there were two sides and one was intimidating the other. The FBI agents wanted to help but struggled to find the mechanisms to do so.”

Full text: 前天我女儿被国保叫去喝茶，并托她给我捎话，不要去旧金山参加活动，在这里我想告诉安徽国保，习近平给中国、世界带来了深重的灾难，不反习天理难容，中国人民包括体制内的大多数人也是受害者，这一点你们心里很清楚，我去抗议习近平也是为你们在发声，你们的前总理说杀就杀，在一党专制和习近平的独载下你们也没有安全感。中国不能再这样下去，我女儿与此事无关，你们请她喝茶实际上是对我的威胁，别来这一套，这只能激怒我，如果再有此类事情发生，我会采取更激烈的行动。See also Ching Fung, Gigi Lee, Chen Zifei, “Hong Kong activist to go ahead with APEC protest despite threats,” Radio Free Asia, 14 Nov 2023, https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/apec-protest-kwok-11142023113816.html.
