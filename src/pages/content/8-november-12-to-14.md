**(and other days leading up to Xi Jinping’s arrival)**

In the days leading up to Xi Jinping’s arrival in San Francisco on November 14, reports began to emerge that large numbers of CCP supporters were being transported to San Francisco from southern California, New York and Philadelphia. (Later, evidence of groups from Portland, Oregon and Seattle also emerged.) 

### Mobilization of Chinese students through CSSAs
Hundreds of Chinese students were bused in from California universities, including University of California (UC) at San Diego, UC Santa Barbara, UC Los Angeles, and California State University, Northridge, among others.
Chinese Students and Scholars Association (中國學生學者聯合（誼）會) branches at California universities were used to recruit Chinese students to “welcome” Xi, as seen in messages circulating among students and scholars at California universities.
CSSAs have a record of surveilling and reporting on Chinese students. They are collectively overseen by the CCP’s United Front Work Department and are often controlled, funded and/or closely watched by Chinese embassies or consulates. The US Department of State says, “…the CCP created the Chinese Students and Scholars Association (CSSA) to monitor Chinese students and mobilize them against views that dissent from the CCP’s stance. That directive has not changed.” The United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission says CSSAs “receive guidance from the CCP through Chinese embassies and consulates—governmental ties CSSAs frequently attempt to conceal—and are active in carrying out overseas Chinese work consistent with Beijing’s United Front strategy.”
An email message from “BCSSA Official”at UC Berkeley told Chinese students that transport to welcoming events for Xi Jinping and meals would be arranged and provided.

Berkeley CSSA students were later seen on November 14 at the “welcome” gathering for Xi Jinping near the San Francisco International Airport. As many as 45 students posed for group photos with the Berkeley CSSA banner.

A message addressed to “executive committee members” said that CSSA representatives at University of Southern California  were informed by the Chinese consulate in Los Angeles that Xi Jinping would be visiting and that students belonging to the USC CSSA were invited. Students were expected to stay in San Francisco for three or four days, the duration of Xi’s visit, and were not allowed to go out on their own or engage in separate activities “for everyone’s safety.” This message also says that all travel, accommodation and food expenses will be covered, notifies students that this “glorious mission” is a significant duty, and advises addressees not to share the contents of the message contents with others. The message also says that once people have signed up, they cannot withdraw.

The same message addressed to executive committee members of the USC CSSA was also sent to the UCLA CSSA executive committee members.

A video by a Chinese student in the US that was posted online confirms that while the event  was coordinated by CSSAs, the buses and meals were provided by the Chinese consulate.A Chinese student who traveled to San Francisco said the Chinese consulate paid for flight tickets from New York City and accommodation.  
It is highly likely that CSSAs at other California universities and in other states were used to mobilize Chinese students in a similar fashion. 
Many young people who were presumably Chinese students were in particular gathered along the airport access road on November 14, the day of Xi Jinping’s arrival.

### Mobilization and transport of other united front groups
In fact, over the course of the four days of Xi Jinping’s visit to San Francisco, Chinese students in general did not appear to make up a large percentage of the CCP supporters at other events and locations besides the airport on November 14. The majority of CCP supporters appeared to be associated with other united front groups.

It was reported in Chinese-language media with good relations with the CCP supporters that between 16 and 20 buses transported about 800 CCP supporters from southern California to San Francisco. The daily cost of each bus rental was at least $5,000. At least 400 rooms were reserved at five different hotels at a rate of at least $150 a night. The entire mobilization from southern California alone was said to have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Almost 1,000 CCP supporters from New York and other areas were transported to San Francisco. The report estimated that altogether as many as 10,000 CCP supporters from various regions would gather in San Francisco.

Overseas Chinese from southern California were also reported to have hired ten armed, uniformed security guards to “maintain order on site.” Over the coming days, security guards who appeared to be associated with CCP supporters were present at all but one of the locations where protesters were harassed, intimidated and assaulted. At least two private security firms were employed. The guards of one firm dressed in distinctive black suits that protesters came to recognize. The guards of the other wore uniforms and many appeared strikingly young. (For more details on these security firms, see below.) Apart from a united front leader from southern California who claimed to have hired the ten mentioned above, it is unclear who exactly hired the security guards. The security guards were seen at times to be working with individuals who may have had direct ties to the PRC. (See below for details.) The guards’ exact responsibilities and purpose often appeared unclear; at times, they themselves appeared not to know. Some protesters reported that the security guards acted aggressively towards them and asserted the authority to determine where they were allowed and not allowed to be while other security guards appeared to have little idea of what they were doing or remained inactive in response to incidents of harassment, intimidation and assault. (See below for details.)

United front groups that traveled from southern California to San Francisco include the All American Chinese Association (南加華人華僑聯合總會/美國南加州華人華僑聯合總會), the Chinese American Unity Alliance (洛杉磯華埠大聯盟), and the Taishan Friendship Association of Southern California (南加台山聯誼會). 

Other united front groups which traveled to San Francisco include the Philadelphia Fujian Association (費城福建同鄉會), the American Lianjiang Association (美國連江同鄉會; Lianjiang is a county in Fujian province), the American Fujian Association (美國福建同鄉會), 

the North American Zhejiang Overseas Chinese Association (北美浙江華僑聯盟社團), and the Los Angeles-based Beijing Association USA (美國北京聯合會). 

While some united front groups seek to obscure their close links with CCP entities and officials, others proudly display them. For example, on the front page of Beijing Association USA’s website are two letters congratulating it. One is from the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese (中華全國歸國華僑聯合會), the top-level CCP United Front group tasked with overseeing relations with overseas Chinese that is mentioned in the introduction above. The other is from China Overseas Friendship Association (中華海外聯誼會), the external name of the 9th Bureau of the CCP’s United Front Work Department, one of two UFWD bureaus tasked with overseeing overseas Chinese affairs.  

Beijing Association USA was one of many united front groups seen lining the route to the Filoli estate where the meeting between Xi Jinping and President Biden took place on November 15.

Another group present along the Filoli route on the 15th was the America Cultural Center of The Chinese Minorities (美國中華民族文化中心) based in Arcadia, California.

Like many united front groups in the US, the America Cultural Center of Chinese Minorities has a minimal public profile, but it is registered as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. 

### United front leaders who organized mobilization and transport

Two individuals were prominent among united front leaders who organized the mobilization and transportation of CCP supporters to San Francisco. 

One of these individuals is Charles Lu Qiang (鹿強). He reportedly organized the mobilization of CCP supporters from southern California. The other is John Chen Shanzhuang (陳善莊) who reportedly organized the mobilization of CCP supporters from New York. 

A brief overview of these two individuals indicates their ties to the CCP. Tracing these ties helps to indicate how the CCP uses united front groups to carry out its agenda abroad. 

Charles Lu Qiang (鹿強) reportedly organized the transport of 16 to 20 buses of CCP supporters from southern California to San Francisco. Lu utilized resources in his travel agency to find transportation and partners for the protest. 

As recently as September 2023, two months before Xi Jinping’s visit to San Francisco, Lu attended the 11th National Congress of Returned Overseas Chinese (第十一次全國歸僑僑眷代表大會) in Beijing, where Xi Jinping and other top CCP leaders attended to congrautespoke. 

He has served as an overseas committee member of the Shang Hai Qiao Lian (上海市僑聯), a local group of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese (中華全國歸國華僑聯合會) in Shanghai.  ACFROC (中國僑聯 [簡稱]) is the top-level CCP United Front group responsible for maintaining relations between the CCP and overseas Chinese. 

In 2015, Lu was one of 38 overseas Chinese invited to attend the main annual session of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (中國人民政治協商會議; CPPCC), the very highest United Front organgroup of the CCP and an advisory body to the PRC governmentChinese state composed of some of the highest-profile CCP supporters. An invitation to an overseas Chinese to attend the annual session of the CPPCC is considered recognition of exceptional contributions to united front work abroad; only “well-known leaders in their host countries” are invited to attend. Lu claimed the conference had an especially good democratic atmosphere. The CPPCC session took place in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. 

He is the honorary founding chairman of the Roundtable of Southern California Chinese-American Organizations (RCAO; 美國南加州華人社團聯合會(簡稱南華聯). As of 2022, RCAO is a coalition made up of at least 170 member organizations. At a ceremony in 2022 inaugurating its 10th leadership team—of which Lu is part in his capacity as honorary founding chairman—the then-Consul General of the PRC consulate in Los Angeles, Zhang Ping, expressed admiration for the work of RCAO as well as gratitude to its past and present leaders. Lu is prominent among them in photos of the event. In one, he stands next to Zhang Sujiu, daughter of General Zhang Zhizhong, whom Mao Zedong appointed to several high-ranking positions in the early decades of the PRC. Zhang herself is, like Lu, an honorary chair of RCAO. 

Lu is also reputed to be a major convener of “patriotic” gatherings of overseas Chinese in southern California to “oppose Taiwan and Hong Kong independence.” 

After having transported 16 to 20 buses of CCP supporters to San Francisco, Lu Qiang himself was apparently present along the route to Filoli estate where the Xi-Biden meeting was held earlier in the day of November 15 along with hundreds of other CCP supporters.

John Chen Shanzhuang (陳善莊); sometimes spelled “John Chan” in English) reportedly played a leading role in mobilizing CCP supporters from New York. 

He’s reported to be the chair of Asian American Community Empowerment (美國亞裔社團聯合總會; it usually goes by the acronym BRACE, owing to its original name, Brooklyn Asian Community Empowerment). He was photographed and interviewed on the streets of San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit wearing a lapel pin of the American Chinese Commerce Association (HK) (美國(香港)旅美華人總商會), another united front group of which he is the chair.

On November 8, only days before he lead CCP supporters to San Francisco, he met Deputy Consul General Wu Xiaoming (吳曉明) of the PRC consulate in New York. The occasion was a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new office for his organization, Asian American Community Empowerment. Wu publicly praised Chen, indicating a close relationship between PRC officials and Chen as a leader of united front groups. More than 100 groups from across the US are reportedly part of the Federation.

Chen has been a leader of united front activities in New York City for upwards of three decades, regularly organizing public gatherings to express support for PRC government positions on matters ranging from the US bombing of the PRC embassy in Belgrade in 1999 to Falun Gong. In March 2023, Chen was prominent at a protest of CCP supporters in New York City against the visit of Taiwanese president Tsai Ing-wen to the US. 

In 1999, he co-founded the American Fuzhou Langqi United Association (美國福州琅岐聯合總會). He is also listed as the chairman of the American Chinese Commerce Association (美華總商會會長), which shares a website with the American Chinese Commerce Association (Hong Kong) (美國(香港)旅美華人總商會), of which he is also president. Besides the organizations mentioned above, he is also reported to be the convener of an organization called Coalition of Asian-Americans for Civil Rights (CAACR) (亞裔維權大聯盟) as well as being head of BRACE (formerly Brooklyn Asian Community Empowerment, now Asian Community Empowerment Inc).

In San Francisco, Chen led supporters to “welcome” Xi outside the St Regis Hotel, where the Chinese delegation was staying, on November 14. Some of them harassed and intimidated protesters.

Besides united front figures like Lu Qiang and Chen Shanzhuang who organized the mobilization and transport of CCP supporters to San Francisco from, respectively, southern California and New York, several other prominent united front leaders participated in the “welcoming” of Xi Jinping in San Francisco. They will be noted as they appear in the timeline of events below. 

Patterns emerge that resemble previous mobilizations of the overseas united front to neutralize protesters going back to the Olympic torch relay in 2008: 
The united front groups have strong ties with the PRC government and are organized by individuals with a record of strong ties with the PRC government. 
Their mobilization is organized and transport and accommodation are provided. 
Those associated with united front groups, including Chinese students, are exhorted to fulfill their patriotic duty and take part in a “glorious mission.”

While a small percentage of CCP supporters who showed up on the streets of San Francisco directly engaged in acts of harassment and assault on protesters, the mobilization of large numbers is meant to “flood the zone,” taking up space especially in locations where Xi is present. This is both to ensure support for Xi and to neutralize potential protesters. The CCP supporters blast patriotic songs and slogans on megaphones at high volume and seek to obscure any views of protesters, their banners and flags. Within the crowds of CCP supporters, many of whom are quite passive, are smaller numbers of people who are tasked or take it upon themselves to more aggressively harass, intimidate and even assault protesters. A number of those who do not directly take these more aggressive measures are sometimes perceived as  complicit with those who do, for example, by using their PRC flags to block any view of the harassment, intimidation and assault. Kennedy Wong, a Hong Kong protester and member of Hong Kong Democracy Council, said, “I was quite frightened because we were outnumbered by CCP supporters; more importantly, some of them were very aggressive.” 

On several occasions, protesters changed their plans due to safety concerns. Tibetan and Uyghur groups had originally planned to march on November 15 to the Hyatt Regency, where Xi was the guest of honor at a banquet, but when they saw the large numbers of CCP supporters gathered outside the hotel and the absence of separate protest zones, they decided against this course of action as they feared it could lead to potentially violent confrontation. Several dozen Tibetans proceeded to the area near the Hyatt Regency, but many Tibetan elders and those with children left. (In fact, those protesters who did brave the crowds of CCP supporters were attacked, as shall be seen.) Once on site, protesters quickly developed protocols and strategies so as to ensure their safety. Often, the effort required of protesters to protect themselves from pro-CCP attackers distracted significant attention from their original objective, protesting against Xi Jinping. All protesters interviewed for this report said they felt in significant danger and were on constant high alert for attacks, stalking and other forms of harassment, intimidation and violence. The mobilization of the united front as well as more aggressive agents affiliated with the CCP did in fact deter protest and created an unsafe environment for protest, thus violating the First Amendment rights of protesters as well as their basic human right to freedom of peaceful assembly.
