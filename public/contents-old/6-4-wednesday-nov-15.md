In the afternoon, US President Joe Biden and Xi Jinping met at Filoli estate, a distance of about 25 miles from downtown San Francisco. Beginning in the morning and stretching into the afternoon, a large rally and march were held by Tibetan, Hong Kong, Uyghur and Chinese protesters. The march began at the Consulate General of the People’s Republic of China in San Francisco and went through downtown San Francisco. In the evening, US business organizations hosted a banquet in honor of Xi Jinping at the Hyatt Regency hotel in downtown San Francisco. Outside the hotel where the Xi banquet took place, there was a pervasive threatening atmosphere; protesters faced constant harassment and intimidation by CCP supporters. Over the course of the day, at least 10 protesters were assaulted by CCP supporters.

Among the serious incidents of the day were: 
- an assault on Chinese activist Wang Wei outside the St Regis; 
- harassment of Tibetan activist Tsela Zoksang and the Tibetan protesters accompanying her as she climbed a flagpole outside the Hyatt Regency; 
- an attack on four Tibetan activists in a parking garage across from the Hyatt Regency by a group of ten to fifteen men;
- an attack on Hong Kong and Tibetan protesters at their designated protest area which had been set up for them by police across from the Hyatt Regency;
- an assault on an elderly Hong Kong protester near the Hyatt Regency; 
- the stalking of Tibetan protesters by the same group of men who attacked the designated protest area as the protesters left the area near the Hyatt Regency at the end of the protest.

**On the route from downtown San Francisco to Filoli estate**

The route from downtown San Francisco to Filoli, where the Biden-Xi meeting took place, was lined with CCP supporters who were bused there from their accommodations. Their positioning along Cañada Road suggests they were alerted to the route that Xi’s motorcade would take to reach Filoli, as there are two possible routes, and they were all lined up along the route the motorcade eventually took. Some Chinese protesters also gathered there. Scuffles broke out among some CCP supporters and Chinese protesters as the CCP supporters used their numbers to try to deny space to the protesters, crowding them out and attempting to ensure that they could not be viewed from vehicles passing on the road.[^101]

**Rally and march protesting against Xi Jinping**

In the morning, Tibetan, Uyghur, Hong Kong and Chinese protesters gathered at the Chinese consulate of San Francisco for a rally. Afterwards, more than one thousand protesters marched through downtown San Francisco.[^102] The march was accompanied by police officers. 

The rally and march were one of the few occasions during the days of Xi Jinping’s visit in San Francisco when protesters were not attacked, harassed or intimidated by CCP supporters. This is primarily due to three factors: 
1. it did not go anywhere near where Xi Jinping was expected or scheduled to be; 
2. it was accompanied by a significant deployment of police officers; 
3. it was large.

onversely, most of the incidents of harassment, intimidation and assault occurred near locations where Xi Jinping was present or expected to be and where CCP supporters outnumbered protesters. At those locations where Xi Jinping was present or expected to be, there were large deployments of police officers, but more often than not, police did not appear to regard the protection of citizens as their primary duty, and their apparent indifference signaled to CCP supporters that they would not be held accountable for their actions.

Only when arriving in downtown San Francisco, at Market and Third Streets, did the marching protesters meet CCP supporters who were already starting to gather in large numbers in the vicinity of the Hyatt Regency hotel, about one block away. The hotel was the venue of the banquet for Xi to be held that evening. The large contingent of Tibetans, hundreds strong, as well as a group of Uyghurs, had originally planned to go to the Hyatt Regency to protest in the evening, but a significant portion of them were dissuaded from doing so by the sight of the large number of CCP supporters already gathering there. They feared there might be confrontations, and for the sake of the safety of the protesters decided it was best to avoid that possibility. Students for a Free Tibet Executive Director Pema Doma said, “We’d originally wanted 500 Tibetans marching toward Tsela’s flag-raising action [see more on that below], but when we saw how many CCP supporters there were and how aggressively they behaved, we decided it was too confrontational to lead the large protest. This was around 4 or 5 pm. We said to the Tibetans, anyone who feels unsafe can go home. Anyone who wants to stay, we will continue to protest. Nearly all the elders and children decided to return home, and a small contingency of mostly young adults remained to have our voices heard.”[103] A smaller group of Uyghurs also decided to leave for the sake of safety.[^104] This is a clear instance of the large numbers of CCP supporters, who had already harassed, intimidated and assaulted a number of protesters, having a deterrent effect on protest. Some Tibetan and Hong Kong activists would later go to the Hyatt Regency to protest, and their experience would substantiate the fears of the Tibetans and Uyghurs who did not go.

While the march was taking place, Chinese activist Wang Wei (王維) was assaulted near the St Regis at about 11 am.[^105] Like Jia Junwei the day before, Wang was not accompanied by other protesters, and his isolation appears to have emboldened his attackers.

Wang Wei testified that he noticed some CCP supporters and started taking videos of them because he feared attack and thought filming them might act as a deterrent or at least provide evidence in case of attack. He wore a “Free China” sticker on his arm and believed this excited their animosity. He and they exchanged sharp words. Then the CCP supporters began attacking him. There were some middle-aged men and a woman wearing a blue cheongsam. She shoved Wang three times. He warned the group that if he was pushed again, he would take action. After another shove, he stuck out a flailing leg, and the men surrounded him and started beating him. They pushed him to the ground. The attackers then surrounded him with their large PRC flags and continued to strike him. One of them stabbed him with the tip of a metal flagpole. Still lying prostrate on the ground and realizing he was all alone, Wang grabbed the leg of a person who tried to kick him. After he grabbed the leg, others began kicking him as well, also continuing to punch him. Wang became disoriented and felt as if he were going to faint. Only later did he learn that he was able to escape due to two white women who broke things up. They placed themselves between Wang and his assailants. They asked him if he was ok and helped him to call the police. Later, an ambulance came and took Wang to the hospital, where he received treatment. He and friends had originally planned to return to Los Angeles, where he lives, that evening, but then discovered that one of the tires of his car was punctured by two large screws. He didn’t know whether or not this was done deliberately. 

In the above video, a young security guard from National Protective Service Private Security, allied with the CCP supporters, makes a feeble attempt to intervene but almost immediately desists. He then turns to a police officer standing on the other side of the black metal fence separating the sidewalk from the road, apparently to point out the assault to him. The police officer takes no action.

Wang later returned to San Francisco to file a report with the police on November 21 about the assault. As of February 1, 2024, when he was interviewed for this report, he had not heard back from the police about whether or not they had taken any action.[^107]

Wang Wei identified the people in the following photographs as his attackers:

![Screen Shot 2024-04-12 at 7.49.09 AM](/images/Screen-Shot-2024-04-12-at-7.49.09-AM.png)[^108]
The attack on Wang Wei involved four united front leaders from the Seattle area. 

One of them, the woman dressed in the blue cheongsam who precipitated the attack on Wang, is named Zhuo Ma (翁西卓瑪, also known as Wengxi Zhuoma; also known as 游泳, or Youyong).[^109] She is President of the Sichuan Association of Washington State (美國華盛頓州四川同鄉總會), a united front group in the Seattle area. According to a bio on a pro-CCP website, she was born into a “revolutionary family” in China and went to the US in 2010. She “welcomed” Xi Jinping on a previous visit of his to the US in 2015 as part of the “special team” of Liang Guoyao (梁國堯), a prominent united front leader holding multiple positions all related to his place of origin, Guangdong Province.[^110]

China Democracy Party (中國民主黨) leader Chen Chuangchuang (陳闖創), who would himself become a victim of assault by CCP supporters the following day, the 16th, said that Zhuo Ma confronted a group of protesters earlier that same morning of the 15th, around 9 am, about two hours before the assault on Wang Wei, and at that time, admitted that she was a member of the Chinese Communist Party.[^111]

A second assailant of Wang Wei from the united front network in the Seattle area is Guo Jianwei (郭建偉).

![Screen Shot 2024-02-23 at 10.43.10 AM](/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-23-at-10.43.10-AM.png)

Guo can be seen punching Wang Wei in the above video (see 1:00). He is president of the Henan Association of Washington State (華州河南同鄉會), a united front group in Seattle. In a speech given at an event celebrating the fourth anniversary of the Henan Association in March 2019, Guo boasted of his organization’s ties to the Henan Province Overseas Chinese Association (河南省僑聯), a United Front group based in Henan province, as well as to the Henan Province Zhi Gong Party (河南省致公黨).[^112] The China Zhi Gong Party is one of the eight minor parties of the PRC under the control of the United Front Work Department. According to united front expert Anne-Marie Brady, “The Zhi Gong Party is a united front link to liaise with overseas Chinese communities….”[^113] It is a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, the top-level United Front body.[^114] Guo was also present at a protest in April 2023 in Los Angeles against Taiwan’s then-President Tsai Ing-wen’s visit to the US and can be seen standing alongside a prominent San Francisco united front leader, He Konghua (何孔華) who also appeared among CCP supporters at the San Francisco International Airport on November 17, the day of Xi’s departure.[^115] (See above and below.) Two other united front figures also attended that protest against Tsai with Guo Jianwei and He Konghua, Jing Dongsheng and Rong Junwu, both of whom were active on the streets of San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit as well. (See above.) While there at the April 2023 Los Angeles protest against Tsai, Guo also appears briefly in a video made by the satirical comic LeLe Farley.[^116]

A third united front leader from the Seattle area involved in the assault on Wang Wei is Fang Weixia (方偉俠), chair of the Association for China’s Peaceful Reunification of Washington State (華盛頓州中國統一促進會會長). He can be seen punching (see 1:00) and kicking (see 1:13) Wang Wei in the above video.

<img src="/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-23-at-10.38.22-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2024-02-23 at 10.38.22 AM" class="w-96" />

In September 2019, he spoke at an event celebrating the 70th anniversary of the founding of the PRC. Zou Yonghong (鄒永紅), Deputy Consul General of the PRC consulate of San Francisco, also spoke at that event. Guo Jianwei (see above) was also present on that occasion.[^117] In June 2022, he met Consul General Zhang Jianmin at the PRC consulate in San Francisco. The latter recognized Fang’s work as head of the Association for China’s Peaceful Reunification of Washington State to promote US-China relations and China’s “peaceful reunification.”[^118]

Lastly, a fourth united front leader involved in the assault on Wang Wei is Chen Wenshen (陳文深). He begins to appear at the 00:47 mark in the above video.

<img src="/images/Screen-Shot-2024-01-09-at-12.35.36-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2024-01-09 at 12.35.36 PM" class="w-96" />

Chen is vice-president of the Fujian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Washington State (華州福建工商會) in the Seattle area. In March 2019, Zou Yonghong (鄒永紅), Deputy Consul General of the Chinese consulate of San Francisco, attended and spoke at the founding ceremony of the Chamber as well as other united front figures including Fang Weixia (方偉俠; see above), president of the Association for China’s Peaceful Reunification of Washington State (華州中國統一促進會會長), and Jing Dongsheng (靖東升; see above), president of the Oregon Association for China’s Peaceful Unification (俄勒岡州中國統一促進會).[^119]

Bald-headed Chen was, according to protesters, probably the most ubiquitous and easily recognizable united front figure on the streets of San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit. He seemed to show up just about everywhere that protesters went. Chen was seen by protesters at the scenes of five incidents of harassment, intimidation and assault in San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit.

In November 2019, Chen was among a group of united front figures in Seattle that welcomed a visiting delegation from the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification (中國和平統一促進會; CCPPNR) from Beijing at an event with the Association for China’s Peaceful Reunification of Washington State (華州中國統一促進會), the united front group of which Fang Weixia (方偉俠, see above) is the president.[^120][^121]  The ACPR’s affiliation with the CCP and PRC was stated explicitly at the meeting by Sun Lingyan, the Deputy Secretary-General of the CCPPNR, who said that then-member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and then-Chair of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference Wang Yang was its president and the executive vice-president was the Minister of the United Front Work Department.[^122][^123]

At least six other people appear to have participated in the assault on Wang Wei (see above video):

### The Hyatt Regency

In the evening of November 15, the National Committee on United States-China Relations and the United States-China Business Council, in cooperation with the Asia Society, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the United States Chamber of Commerce, and China General Chamber of Commerce-USA,[^124] held a banquet for Xi Jinping at the Hyatt Regency hotel in downtown San Francisco. Hundreds of CCP supporters gathered outside the hotel as well as dozens of Chinese, Hong Kong and Tibetan protesters. While US business and political elites feted Xi, at least eight protesters were assaulted by CCP supporters, several violent attacks occurred, and an atmosphere of intimidation was pervasive outside the hotel.

The banquet was attended by more than 300 US business executives[^125] as well as high-level political figures. Individual seats at the banquet went for $2,000 each, while companies could purchase eight seats at a table plus one seat at Xi Jinping’s table for $40,000.[^126] The host organizations are among those that have for decades been in the forefront of advocating a US policy of so-called “engagement” with China, which in practice has meant a prioritization of business, finance and trade interests to the detriment of other important issues such as national security and human rights. Unsurprisingly, no one spoke about those latter issues at the banquet, and no one advocating for human rights or a higher prioritization of national security was present.[^127]

Xi Jinping received standing ovations[^128] from the business executives and political leaders, a spectacle the PRC state propaganda organ CCTV covered with relish.[^129]

The first speech of the evening was given by Marc Casper, who is both Chairman of the U.S.-China Business Council, and Chairman, President, and CEO of Thermo Fisher Scientific.[^130]

Thermo Fisher has for years been criticized by human rights groups for selling DNA identification technology to repressive public security organs in Xinjiang, Tibet and China.[^131] In fact, one of the institutional authors of this report, Students for a Free Tibet, has campaigned extensively against Thermo Fisher helping PRC authorities to steal Tibetan DNA.[^132] During the banquet, over which Caspar presided, SFT members were attacked by CCP supporters no more than several hundred yards away.

Among those attending the banquet were representatives of the host organizations as well as many prominent US business executives[^133] and California political elites.[^134] As per the evening’s decorum, nothing controversial was mentioned.

Many of those interviewed for this report—especially but not exclusively those residing in California—believed the emphasis by high-profile and influential California politicians on “good relations” between California and the US on the one hand and China on the other has contributed to the complacent environment that lead to authorities in San Francisco being unprepared for, and perhaps unconcerned about or indifferent to, the attacks by CCP supporters perpetrated on the city’s streets.

California Governor Gavin Newsom was among the first to greet Xi Jinping as the latter stepped off his jet at San Francisco International Airport on November 14.[^135]

![Screen Shot 2024-02-29 at 11.52.57 AM](/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-29-at-11.52.57-AM.png)

Before the banquet for Xi at the Hyatt Regency, Newsom presented Xi with a Golden State Warriors jersey. This occurred while residents of his state were being beaten by Xi Jinping’s supporters outside.

![Screen Shot 2024-02-29 at 11.54.29 AM](/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-29-at-11.54.29-AM.png)

In October 2023, just weeks before, Newsom visited Hong Kong and China, where he met Xi, a visit that was heavily criticized by 20 California-based groups representing Hong Kongers, Taiwanese, Tibetans and Uyghurs as well as 43 other Hong Kong, Tibetan, Uyghur, Chinese, Taiwanese and human rights groups in a joint letter to Newsom.[^136] In the lead-up to Newsom’s trip, he ruled out discussing human rights with his counterparts in Hong Kong and China. Human Rights Watch called on him to do so.[^137] Eventually, after pressure from bipartisan political leaders and human rights groups, his office reported that he raised the issue, though it did not report specifically to whom he spoke or or in what context.[^138] HKDC Executive Director Anna Kwok attempted to arrange a meeting with Newsom while both were in San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit. The meeting did not occur; instead, Newsom’s office sent her a link to its press statement about his trip to the PRC.[^139]

To date, no California politicians–not the mayor of San Francisco, nor the governor of the state, nor any other prominent political figures–have said anything about the harassment, intimidation and assaults by CCP supporters in San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit.[^140]

Chair Mike Gallagher (R-WI) of the House Select Committee on the CCP wrote to the hosts of the banquet criticizing them and requesting information about the dinner, including a full guest list and breakdown of proceeds.[^141]

Harassment, intimidation, and attempted attack on flagpole protester

In mid-afternoon, shortly after 3 pm, before the start of the banquet, Students for a Free Tibet Grassroots Coordinator Tsela Zoksang and a group of young Tibetan protesters went to the front of the Hyatt Regency, where Tsela began to climb a flagpole. They had excited very little attention from the CCP supporters as they passed through the crowd, but once she began to climb the flagpole, the CCP supporters suddenly realized she and her companions were protesters and began attacking them.

According to Tsela, “When I first began to go up the flagpole, I spent about 30 to 45 minutes just hovering a bit above head level. I didn’t go further during that time because of technical difficulty with the webbing that took some time to troubleshoot. Most CCP supporters initially assumed I was one of them. But once I unfurled the banner reading, ‘Dictator Xi, Your Time Is Up,’ they began to get rowdy and the situation rapidly escalated. Like me, plenty of young Tibetans were ‘camouflaged’ but once I began unfurling the banner, things descended into chaos. The CCP supporters began grabbing at the banner. It was held up by tent poles, which they got hold of and began wielding like weapons. They waved huge Chinese flags in my face, and used their flagpoles like weapons. Because I was holding on to the banner, I was pulled every which way and the CCP supporters grabbed at my legs. But CCP supporters were going after Tibetan protesters far more than they were going after me. Lots of young Tibetans were pushed and shoved to the ground. I saw one person shoved to the ground, and two whacked in the face and poked in the eye with flagpoles. My banner was snatched away. But I had a flag. I resolved the technical issue with the webbing and began to climb up. I got to about 25 to 30 feet above the ground and took out the flag.”[^142]

In this video, Tsela can be seen to have climbed to that height. The large PRC flags previously blocking her from view at a lower height can be seen below her.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/18EbI0wbZjUKqI0QzwUYNods0-hnoQ1sH/preview" class="sm:w-full lg:w-1/2 h-80 " allow="autoplay"></iframe>

Tsela would remain on the flagpole holding out the Tibetan flag for several hours from 3:15 pm to 8:45 pm while the banquet went on inside the hotel.

A 17-year-old Tibetan protester accompanying Tsela near the base of the flagpole said, “We were a group of about a dozen teenagers. CCP supporters pulled our shirts. I was pushed, shoved and pulled.”[^143]

Topjor Tsultrim, Communications Coordinator with Students for a Free Tibet, corroborated Tsela’s report that CCP supporters pulled at her legs and tried to cover her with huge PRC flags: “One grabbed my friend’s butt and groped her, then accused us of pushing him. A CCP supporter followed me with a loudspeaker blasting propaganda into my ear. His own security guard told him to back off. There were several men who seemed to be calling the shots. They had earpieces and tried to take [Tsela’s banner] and kept snatching at her.” 

Topjor also singled out a woman in a purple jacket.[^144]

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IlJvzu9f_oLAt78cFhCKrHnAu6RiD4W0/preview" class="sm:w-full lg:w-1/2 h-80 " allow="autoplay"></iframe>

After Tsela ascended the flagpole, this woman and her accompanying security guard tried to prevent Topjor from leaving the area near the base of the flagpole by repeatedly moving to stand in front of him and telling him he could not leave. Later in the evening, he saw her at a checkpoint outside the Hyatt Regency. At this point, the police officers at the checkpoint were allowing only hotel workers and banquet guests to enter the hotel. She told the police officers, “Let me through,” showed her badge, and was allowed to enter the hotel. This gave Topjor the impression that she may have been associated with or even a part of the Chinese delegation accompanying Xi Jinping at the banquet that evening. Topjor saw her also on the 14th near the airport when Xi was due to arrive in San Francisco and again on the 17th when he was to depart. Then too she was accompanied by security guards who appeared to be acting as her bodyguards. She was liaising with a police officer who appeared to be showing her his contact details that she copied down on her phone. Another man prevented Topjor from approaching her.[^145] (For more on the woman at the San Francisco International Airport on November 17, see below. In both locations she was accompanied by what appeared to be her own personal security guard.)

Sonamtso, who is on the international board of directors for Students for a Free Tibet, was among those who accompanied Tsela. She said even after Tsela ascended the flagpole, Tibetans on the ground continued to be harassed and intimidated: “CCP supporters used giant flags and tried to tie them to the black metal fence the police had put up. One of us put up the Tibetan flag. They removed it. They tried to block us from public view. There was a woman in green constantly trying to obscure our view. She was really into this, like it was the only thing she was tasked with. She continued to shove the Chinese flag in front of us. That went on for some time. I tried to communicate with police about what was happening, and I pointed her out to them. I told the police, You have to do something. They’re all over, and we’re not allowed to move.” The police gave the Tibetans an ultimatum: go to a designated protest zone on the other side of the street or leave. Sonamtso wanted the Tibetans to be safe but was afraid that moving away from Tsela would leave her more vulnerable. Eventually, the Tibetans agreed to move.[^146]

![Screen Shot 2024-02-28 at 10.45.53 AM](/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-28-at-10.45.53-AM.png)

The woman in green can be seen incessantly hitting protesters with her small flags in this video below. Eventually, a police officer directs her to back away. The woman in purple, suspected of being affiliated with the Chinese consulate or delegation, attempts meekly to intercede on the woman in green’s behalf.[^147]

The woman in green appears to be associated with the American Fujian Association (美國福建同鄉會; AFA; sometimes rendered into English—including by the group itself—as the Fukien American Association). She has appeared together with Chen Heng (陳恆), the chair of AFA, at AFA events.

In San Francisco, they also stood side by side:

![Screen Shot 2024-02-28 at 10.49.46 AM](/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-28-at-10.49.46-AM.png)

Chen himself was present at the flagpole, and in fact played a high-profile role, at one point attempting to snatch the “Dictator Xi, your time is up” banner from Tsela (at 00:15 in the video).

Chen Heng is an associate of John Chen Shanzhuang, the united front leader from New York who was reported to be responsible for mobilizing and transporting CCP supporters from there to San Francisco to “welcome” Xi. Chen appears in the background of this photo of Chen outside the St. Regis. 

![John Chen St Regis 14nov23 Jungho Kim The Standard CHEN HENG IN BACKGROUND](/images/John-Chen-St-Regis-14nov23-Jungho-Kim-The-Standard-CHEN-HENG-IN-BACKGROUND.png)

Chen Heng has appeared alongside Chen Shanzhuang on other occasions as well, such as the CCP supporters’ protest against then-Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen’s visit to New York in March 2023.

Chen Heng is also an associate of Harry Lu Jianwang (盧建旺), who was arrested by the FBI in April 2023 for his role in operating an undeclared police station of the Chinese government in Chinatown in Manhattan.[^148] According to the complaint against Lu and a co-defendant, “the defendants worked together to establish the first known overseas police station in the United States on behalf of the Fuzhou branch of the MPS [Ministry of Public Security].” Lu is reported to be one of three co-chairs of the Fujian Association, along with Chen Heng and Chen Lundong. When asked by a reporter about Lu's arrest, Chen said he was surprised to learn of it.[^149] The complaint alleges that since 2015, Lu “was directed to assist the PRC government’s repressive activities on U.S. soil.” One of the examples given: “In 2015, during PRC President Xi Jinping’s visit to the United States, Lu participated in counterprotests in Washington, D.C. against members of a religion that is forbidden under PRC law.” That activity appears similar to what his Fujian Association co-chair Chen Heng was doing in San Francisco. In the following undated photo, Chen Heng is seen sitting to the right of the current Mayor of New York, Eric Adams. Next to Adams on the other side is Wu Xiaoming, Deputy Consul General of the Chinese consulate of New York City, and next to him, Harry Lu Jianwang.

Another figure from New York who can be seen in the above video (from 00:19 to 00:33) attempting to snatch the “Dictator Xi, your time is up” banner from Tsela is Shi Yong Wei. He does so right after Chen Heng and in fact gets a better grip on it than Chen Heng did and nearly manages to snatch it.

![Screen Shot 2024-01-29 at 10.26.38 AM](/images/Screen-Shot-2024-01-29-at-10.26.38-AM.png)

Shi is reportedly a convicted felon. He was arrested by the FBI in September 2003 for extortion.[^150] According to his own account, published in his book, The Son Of Qinghua: Shi Yong Wei's 15-Year Prison Saga After Being Falsely Convicted In The U.S. Federal Legal System, Shi spent 15 years in federal prison.[^151]

![Screen Shot 2024-01-29 at 11.15.13 AM](/images/Screen-Shot-2024-01-29-at-11.15.13-AM.png)

In October 2023, weeks before Xi Jinping’s visit to San Francisco, he appeared at an art exhibition flanking Huang Ping (黄屏), the Consul General of the Chinese consulate in New York.[^152]

Chen Heng also appears in a video (at 8:04) by the satirical vlogger LeLe Farley taken in front of the Hyatt Regency on the afternoon of November 15.[^153] That video shows another united front figure present at the scene, Wang Jianming (王建明). From 8:21 to 8:52, he comes into the frame holding a megaphone in his right hand and an American flag in his left. (Among CCP supporters in San Francisco, megaphones were typically held by organizers or leaders.) He is president of the Pennsylvania Association for China’s Peaceful Unification (賓州中國和平統一促進會).[^154] He may have led the delegation of CCP supporters from Philadelphia that was reported to be present in San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit. 

![Screen Shot 2024-02-07 at 1.08.44 PM](/images/Screen-Shot-2024-02-07-at-1.08.44-PM.png)

When Tibetan protester Tsela Zoksang came down from the flagpole at the end of the evening, after five hours, she was cited by the San Francisco police for “trespassing.” Police told her they did this at the behest of the Hyatt Regency. This is the only known law enforcement action taken in response to a suspected criminal offense outside of the Hyatt Regency on November 15.[^155]

**Parking Garage Attack**
Tsela was still up the flagpole, about 25 to 30 feet in the air, when four Tibetan protesters were attacked in a parking garage across from the Hyatt Regency. The garage is called the Hearst Parking Center. The protesters unfurled a large banner about 30 by 15 feet in size from one of the higher floors. It read, “Dictator Xi Jinping, your time is up! Free Tibet.”

![signal-2024-04-12-103622_002.jpeg](/images/signal-2024-04-12-103622_002.jpeg)

Only minutes after unfurling the banner, they suddenly felt a violent tug on it from below. Because of the size and weight of the banner, it had special straps through which to put one's hands in order to hold it up. The sudden violence of the tug was such that it lifted three of the four protesters off the ground. Because they had their hands through the straps, they could not immediately let go of the banner, and one of them was lifted off of the ground and almost pulled over the side of the building, which most likely would have resulted in a fatal fall. His hands were lacerated in the incident.

<img src="/images/signal-2024-04-05-124419_003.jpeg" alt="signal-2024-04-05-124419_003.jpeg" class="img-sm">

Later, when he had the opportunity to confront his attackers, he shouted at them, "I almost died because of you.” For the sake of safety, the protesters extracted their hands from the banner straps and let it fall. Then they went downstairs to look for it. They found it lying on a lower floor and tried to unfurl it again. As they did, they were attacked by about 15 masked men. The attackers ripped the banner out of the protesters’ hands and ran away. The protesters ran after them and took video.[^156] The video begins from the moment after the attackers ripped the banner from the protesters’ hands and shows them running to the elevator in the parking garage.

<img src="/images/Still-from-IMG-2340-2.png" alt="Still from IMG_2340 2.png" class="img-sm">


Between the videos, about 10 attackers can be seen in the elevators, the doors of which the protesters were able to momentarily hold open with their feet.

In the elevator lobby, the face of another attacker was caught on video.

This is him in the elevator just before then with his face masked:

<img src="/images/Still-from-IMG-2340-2.png" alt="Still from IMG_2340 2" class="img-sm">

He was later seen outside among the CCP supporters, standing right next to Li Huahong, the founder of Chinese Anti-Cult World Alliance (CACWA) who led the attack on Jia Junwei outside the St Regis on November 14.


![signal-2024-04-05-131148_002](/images/signal-2024-04-05-131148_002.jpeg)

A third attacker in the parking garage wore a CACWA jacket.

<img src="/images/CACWA-in-parking-garage.png" alt="CACWA in parking garage" class="img-sm">

The attackers eventually managed to close the elevator doors on the protesters who confronted them and disappear while a few other attackers descended a nearby spiral ramp intended for cars.

After that, one of the Tibetan protesters, Chemi Lhamo, Campaigns Director with Students for a Free Tibet, unfurled a Tibetan flag from the parking garage. While she did so, she was watched by a man in a green shirt who disappeared and then returned with two security guards employed by the parking garage. The security guards told her and the other Tibetan protesters to leave the parking garage. Chemi Lhamo said, “Why is he [the man in the green shirt] allowed to be here but not me? Didn’t you see we got attacked by 15 people?” One security guard took two of the Tibetan protesters and ushered them away. The other tried to take Chemi Lhamo.  The man in the green shirt ripped the Tibetan flag out of Chemi Lhamo’s hands, though she warned him not to. The next day, November 16, Chemi Lhamo happened to encounter the man on the street near the Moscone Center, the main APEC venue, and took a video of him from which the following screenshot was taken:

<img src="/images/Screen-Shot-2024-04-12-at-2.26.08-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2024-04-12 at 2.26.08 PM" class="img-sm">

The security guard put Chemi Lhamo’s arms behind her back and pushed her to the elevator doors. She said, “Let go of me. You’re hurting me.” The security guard led her out of the parking garage through a California Pizza Kitchen restaurant on the ground floor and to the street, where Chemi Lhamo spotted some of the same men who had attacked her and the others in the parking garage. The men quickly fled, blending into the crowd of CCP supporters gathered there.


Chemi Lhamo says the group of men seemed trained and that they seemed to act with military discipline. Their faces were covered with masks. They clutched at their masks to make sure they stayed on and tried to avoid appearing on camera. They appeared to have gotten the parking garage security guards to carry out work on their behalf. 

While the attack happened, Students for a Free Tibet Executive Director Pema Doma had been outside on the street. One of the Tibetan protesters inside the garage called her on the phone and told her about the attack. She went to the police and told them that a group of men in the parking garage were assaulting her friends. She recalls the police officer replied that there had been fighting all day long there and the police didn’t care about breaking up fights. Pema Doma responded, “It’s not a fight. It’s a group of adults hurting four young people.” The police officer then said that the young people shouldn’t have gone into the parking garage in the first place. At that point, one of the Tibetan protesters who’d been attacked in the parking garage appeared and urgently asked the police for help, saying his friends were still inside but he had lost them and didn’t know where they were. The police replied that they couldn’t do anything. Several of those with SFT then managed on their own to find the other Tibetan protesters who had been inside the parking garage. The police took no action in response to the reports about the incident.[^157]

At about 6:30 pm, Hong Kong protesters were followed and photographed by a man in a suit whom they suspected of being affiliated with CCP authorities. This occurred near the intersection of Market and Third Streets and lasted for about five minutes.[^158]

<img src="/images/Kennedy-APEC-week-K1.JPG" alt="Kennedy-APEC week-K1" class="img-sm">

When one Hong Kong protester tried taking a photo of the man in response to his surveillance, the man moved his phone away from them, but then moments later again began filming them. This pattern repeated itself three times. Only when one Hong Kong protester stepped toward him did he turn away and walk off, though turning back repeatedly to look at them. The man has been identified as He Yong (何勇). He is Communist Party branch secretary, vice-chair and secretary general of China Zhongguancun Precision Medicine Science and Technology Foundation (中關村精準醫學基金).[^159] By definition, as party secretary, he would be a member of the CCP. The foundation describes itself as a charitable organization but emphasizes that it “adheres to the overall leadership” of the CCP and “establishes grassroots organizations of the Party...strictly enforcing political discipline, political rules and organizational discipline, and gives full play to its political core role.”[^160] He also appears to be the president of the Beijing Huaxian Chamber of Commerce (北京滑縣企業商會會長).[^161] It is unclear what role He Yong was playing on the streets of San Francisco, but the Hong Kong protesters regarded him as acting suspiciously and perhaps surveilling them. 

A united front figure who was seen in the crowd of CCP supporters near the Hyatt Regency on the 15th and whom protesters suspected of being an organizer or coordinator is Chen Zhaojin (陳兆進).


<img src="/images/accused-of-being-onsite-commander.jpeg" alt="accused of being onsite commander" class="img-sm">

He is from the Bay Area. On the following day, the 16th, he was involved in a scuffle with Chinese protesters near the Moscone Center, where several assaults occurred. In a screenshot of a video of the scuffle, he can be seen to be wearing what appears to be a walkie-talkie on his belt.


<img src="/images/signal-2024-04-09-122858-002.jpeg" alt="signal-2024-04-09-122858_002" class="img-sm">[^162]

This increased the suspicion of some protesters that he had an organizing or coordinating role among CCP supporters.

On August 31, 2023, just a little over two months before Xi’s visit to San Francisco, he attended the 2023 New Generation of Overseas Chinese Guangzhou Roundtable (2023年新生代海外僑胞廣州圓桌會) where he was among seven “representative individuals” from the new generation of overseas Chinese to give a speech.[^163] His speech is published on the website the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party (中國致公黨廣東省委員會), the united front political party which is used to maintain relations with united front figures abroad.[^164] There, he mentions that he is a native of Guangzhou and lives in the Bay Area and that he has participated in “a series of patriotic activities” of overseas Chinese since the age of 19. Chen also attended some of the same pro-CCP protests in 2023 against Taiwan political leaders as other united front figures from the west coast.[^165]

**Barricade Attack**
The next attack occurred later that evening, between 7:30 and 8 pm. Its target was the Hong Kong and Tibetan protesters gathered in the designated protest zone on the corner of Third and Jessie Streets that had been set up by the police in order to separate the CCP supporters and protesters gathered around the flagpole. The attack was carried out by a group of about a dozen CCP supporters and appears to have been premeditated. The group was photographed creeping up Jessie Street toward Third armed with metal poles which looked like flagpoles.

<img src="/images/signal-2024-01-25-194608-002.jpeg" alt="signal-2024-01-25-194608_002" class="img-sm">

One of the attackers can be seen in this video to be holding at least five poles. The man was seen later with only one pole. Some other CCP supporters around the area had poles with them later.

*TAKEN FROM THE PROTEST ZONE*

As the group of CCP supporters came to the corner of Third and Jessie, where the designated protest zone was demarcated by metal barriers, they confronted the protesters.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wGPP0qZSulxSsnJC_eA2bcVVnb93oEu3/preview" class="sm:w-full lg:w-1/2 h-96" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

HKDC Executive Director, Anna Kwok, who was in the designated protest zone, said that police lined Third Street, separating both protesters and CCP supporters from the Hyatt Regency, and originally, there was a small group of police officers at the intersection of Third and Jessie Streets, between the Hong Kong and Tibetan protesters on one side of Jessie and the CCP supporters on the other side. But after a while, those police officers disappeared and “things went downhill after that. Thugs appeared between 7:30 to 7:50 pm and tried to provoke violence.”[^166]

About ten minutes before they attacked, around 7:20 pm, from the other direction, along Third Street, a single person entered the designated protest zone, where he was seen taking photos of protesters at close range. He was confronted by Hong Kong protesters, upon which he fled.

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H92XkQa_SmiZ5YR8taUNCjLR3vsGylRt/preview" class="sm:w-full lg:w-1/2 h-96" allow="autoplay"></iframe>

As he was fleeing, other men prevented protesters from giving chase. One of those men was the bald-headed Chen Wenshen, vice-president of the Fujian Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Washington State (華州福建工商會) in the Seattle area (see above), who had been present at the attack on Wang Wei outside the St Regis Hotel earlier that day, as well as near the flagpole at the Hyatt Regency, and would again be seen near the Moscone Center on the 16th and at the San Francisco airport on the 17th, all locations where incidents of harassment, intimidation and assault occurred.



<img src="/images/Kennedy-APEC-week-K4.png" alt="Kennedy-APEC week-K4" class="img-sm">

About ten to fifteen minutes after that, the attackers attempted to enter the designated protest area. Some videos of the incident appear to show what might be characterized as a “melee” or “scuffle” involving both CCP supporters and protesters, but as the sequence narrated here shows, it was the CCP supporters that attempted to violently encroach upon the designated protest zone set up by the police, and while the attackers were armed, the protesters were not. Once attacked, some young Tibetan protesters attempted to defend the protest zone, pushing back against the attackers. In interviews, they said their reason for doing so was that some of the people in the protest zone were women and others were older, including some parents, and they wanted to protect them. They were also aware of death threats having been made against HKDC Executive Director Anna Kwok and were intent on protecting her.[^167] Kwok, in turn, was aware of their solicitude: “Tibetans and others surrounded me to protect me; due to the threats, we prepared for the possibility of targeted kidnapping.”[^168]

</div>

The attackers used umbrellas and metal poles to hit protesters and stab at them. One man can be seen in the video trying to unsheath his flagpole, presumably so as to better use it as a weapon. They also threw water bottles full of water as well as sand.

In an interview, another 17-year-old Tibetan said, I got hit in the head three to four times by metal flagpoles…. I got sand thrown in my eyes. I was blinded for about five minutes. They started hitting us. We backed up. They put a big flag in front of my face. Then I got hit again. A lot of people got hit, not just me. Another person was hit four times.[^170]

HKDC Executive Director Anna Kwok said, “The police… on Third Street were reluctant to move. They didn’t want to leave their positions. We screamed and shouted at them, but none paid us any attention…. I contacted the FBI and said there was danger.[^171] They asked if anyone called the police. I said the police officers on site were no help. They asked if I had means to leave the area. I said, ‘I cannot leave other people behind, we want to stay and peacefully protest without violence or fear.’ They said they wanted to see if a plan could be in place if it became more dangerous. In the end, we relied on ourselves to continue through the night.”[^172]

The attackers who came up Jessie Street appear to have been joined by some who came across Jessie Street from the other side, where a banner of the Chinese Anti-Cult World Alliance had been hung. 

![Chinese Anti-Cult World Alliance banner](/images/Chinese-Anti-Cult-World-Alliance-banner.png)

In fact, while none of those who crept up Jessie Street and then attacked the protesters were dressed in CACWA attire, at least two CACWA-attired CCP supporters can be seen involved in the attack on the designated protest zone. 

CACWA founder and leader Li Huahong herself was present at the scene and part of the group that carried out the attack.

She had already participated in the attack on Jia Junwei on November 14 (see above) and had earlier on November 15 taunted protesters in the designated protest zone while standing next to a man who had been involved in the attack on Tibetan protesters in the parking garage (see above).

Unlike in the parking garage attack earlier, many of those who attacked the designated protest zone did not wear masks.

One of the attackers is Liu Baohai (劉寶海) who was seen elsewhere on the streets of San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit and has been active in united front circles.


<img class="img-sm" src="/images/Screen-Shot-2024-01-25-at-9.14.58-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2024-01-25 at 9.14.58 PM" >

One of the victims of an attack by pro-CCP supporters submitted this photo, taken earlier in the day, and identified both figures in it as involved in the attacks. The one on the left is Liu Baohai.

<img class="img-sm" src="/images/Liu-Baohai-and-one-other.jpeg" alt="Liu Baohai and one other" >

Liu Baohai was also pictured near the flagpole in front of the Hyatt Regency that Tsela climbed. In this photo, he is nearly swallowed up by the huge PRC flag being used to block the view of Tsela.

He was also seen near the San Francisco International Airport on November 17.

Liu was photographed by a Chinese-language media outlet at a protest against the visit of then-Taiwan Vice-President William Lai Ching-te (賴清德) to San Francisco on August 16, 2023.[^173] The outlet reports that Liu held a megaphone and led CCP supporters in chanting slogans. He told the publication that he is Fujianese. The publication reported that “nearly 100” CCP supporters protested outside the Hyatt Regency.[^174] The united front leader from Oregon, Jing Dongsheng (靖東升) was also at that protest. During Xi Jinping’s stay in San Francisco, Jing participated in the harassment and intimidation of one protester and appeared to act as a scout on the lookout for protesters as well. (See above.)

Liu also participated in a united front protest against then-Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen’s visit to Los Angeles in April 2023. There, he’s pictured with a united front figure from San Francisco, He Konghua (何孔華), who was also present in San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit on November 17 at the airport. (See below.) Two other united front figures who were also on the streets of San Francisco attended that anti-Tsai protest, Jing Dongsheng (靖東升), and Chen Zhaojin (陳兆進).  CCP supporters were reportedly paid $400 to demonstrate against Tsai.[^175]

### Stalking Incident 
After the end of the protest, some of the protesters who left the designated protest zone were stalked by the same group of people who had attacked them there. A little more than a dozen attackers followed them down Market Street for blocks. There were about a dozen Tibetan protesters altogether: some women in their twenties, including SFT Campaigns Director Chemi Lhamo, along with some older people and teenagers. While many protesters were leaving the area at about the same time, the stalkers chose to target the youngest Tibetan protesters. As the group of protesters passed an alleyway, they saw the CCP supporters who had attacked them. When the CCP supporters saw them, one of them threw down his cigarette and led the others to follow the protesters, which gave the protesters the impression the CCP supporters had been waiting for them to pass. The CCP supporters dragged their metal poles on the ground, making a scraping noise that the protesters believed was intended to intimidate them. When they were certain the CCP supporters were following them, the protesters began videoing them.

A number of the stalkers are clearly recognizable from the photos and videos of the attack on the designated protest zone.  Because of the harassment and attacks at the Hyatt Regency, the Tibetan protesters had heightened vigilance, and this group of protesters had made arrangements to chaperone some in the group to the subway and others to a van waiting to pick them up. The CCP supporters smirked and laughed at the protesters as they followed them.

At one point, Chemi Lhamo told a by-stander they were being followed, hoping that the by-stander might assist them.

<img class="img-sm" src="/images/IMG_0284.jpg" alt="IMG_0284" >

The by-stander did not initially appear to be part of the group of stalkers; nor did he appear to be East Asian, according to Chemi. The by-stander said he was with “them,” referring to the stalkers. He then joined the group of stalkers. Chemi said it was a strange and inexplicable incident that gave her the impression that the stalkers were from the area and perhaps part of a gang or other local organization. 

The protesters reported the stalking to two police officers who were standing on the street.

One officer replied that since it is a free country, the police couldn’t just stop people on the street.[^176] Chemi also informed the officers that the people following them “have been assaulting people.” The officers failed to act. The stalkers passed the officers and walked in front of the protesters. Because of this and the officers’ inaction, the protesters decided to turn around and walk the other way, in the opposite direction of where they had intended to go. They communicated by phone with the other Tibetan protesters they had planned to rendezvous with and arranged to be picked up at a different location.[^177]

SFT Executive Director Pema Doma was in communication with the group by phone and arranged to have them picked up. She said, “Those involved experienced this as a very scary incident. It was most traumatic for the young people. It causes long-lasting fear: is somebody following me still?”[^178]


### Assault on Chow Kai-hong

Also near the Hyatt Regency on the evening of the 15th, a 74-year-old Hong Kong protester named Chow Kai-hong / Zhou Qihong (周啟鴻; also commonly referred to as 周伯--Chow Baak, 伯 meaning “uncle”) was assaulted. The attack occurred outside The Hearst Building on Third Street near its intersection with Market Street, just down the block from the Hyatt Regency. At least five men were involved in the attack. One man shoved Chow to the ground. 

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Myxa0aUYE781mfxiqjzMZz3J-U7G7EzN/preview" class="sm:w-full lg:w-2/3 h-3/3 sm:h-80" allow="autoplay"></iframe>[^179]

Chow says that throughout the incident, he tried his best to protect his head and chest. He had a pacemaker and didn’t want the assailants to damage it. His right shoulder, right hand, left shoulder and right leg were injured in the attack.[^180]

 

<div class="grid grid-cols-2">
<p class="text-center col-span-2">The man who pushed Chow to the ground has been identified as Yu Yingqiang (余穎強; in English, he appears to go by Wing Yu).</p>

Yu appeared elsewhere on the streets of San Francisco, including at the encounter between united front leader Jing Dongsheng and protester Ma Yongtian (see above)…

…and earlier on the 15th near Market Street, about one block from the Hyatt Regency, among CCP supporters…

…and again at the airport on November 17 among the scrum of CCP supporters that assaulted Chemi Lhamo (see below)…

![Yu Yingqiang at airport 17nov23](/images/Yu-Yingqiang-at-airport-17nov23.png)

Protesters suspected him of playing either a coordinating or scouting role or both, as he was viewed on two occasions wearing earpieces, frequently communicating on his phone, and apparently being on the lookout. 

Yu appears to be based in the Portland, Oregon area. Unlike many of the other identified harassers, intimidators, and assailants, he does not appear to have a history of involvement in united front organizations.[^182] It is unclear how such a previously unassuming person with no apparent history of united front involvement found himself to be playing a fairly active role, including assaulting a protester, on the streets of San Francisco. It is possible he was recruited by Jing Dongsheng, also of Portland, with whom he appears in Ma Yongtian’s video and out front of the Hyatt Regency.

Chow would be assaulted again by CCP supporters on November 17 near the airport when he was in the company of Kaiyu Zhang, the victim of one of the most brutal assaults during Xi Jinping’s visit. (See below) On November 21, Chow filed a report with police in regard to both assaults, on the 15th and the 17th.[^183]

[^121]: As noted above, in 2020, the US Department of State designated the umbrella organization for state and local APCR/Us, the Association for China’s Peaceful Unification as a Foreign Mission of the PRC, stating, “The United Front Work Department (UFWD) is the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) organ tasked with co-opting and neutralizing threats to the party’s rule and spreading its influence and propaganda overseas.  The CCP regards this party apparatus as a “magic weapon” to advance Beijing’s policies. Today, the Department of State designated a UFWD-controlled organization – the National Association for China’s Peaceful Unification (NACPU) – as a foreign mission of the PRC under the U.S. Foreign Missions Act.  The goal of this action is to shine a light on this organization and make clear that their messages come from Beijing.” The State Department says, “Authentic people-to-people exchanges are crucial for establishing understanding between cultures, but the UFWD is not a vehicle for people-to-people exchange.  Instead, it uses front organizations like the NACPU to advance the PRC’s propaganda and malign influence.  Our actions today move us a step closer toward a relationship with the PRC based on transparency and reciprocity.” See Michael R. Pompeo, Secretary of State, “Designation of the National Association for China’s Peaceful Unification (NACPU) as a Foreign Mission of the PRC,” US Department of State, 28 Oct 2020, https://2017-2021.state.gov/designation-of-the-national-association-for-chinas-peaceful-unification-nacpu-as-a-foreign-mission-of-the-prc/.

[^123]: The man suspected of carrying out a shooting in a California church attended primarily by people of Taiwanese background on May 15, 2022 was associated with the Las Vegas Association for China’s Peaceful Unification and reportedly attended its founding meeting on April 2, 2019 where he introduced a banner that called for the “eradication of pro-independence demons.” (See Hwang Chun-mei, “California church shooter in Taiwan 'peaceful reunification' group linked to Beijing,” Radio Free Asia, https://www.rfa.org/english/news/china/shooter-05172022104957.html) He was charged with 98 counts of federal hate crimes and weapons and explosives offenses, including the murder of one person and attempted murder of 44 others. (See US Department of Justice, “Nevada Man Charged with Federal Hate Crimes for Irvine Taiwanese Presbyterian Church Shooting,” 11 May 2023, https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nevada-man-charged-federal-hate-crimes-irvine-taiwanese-presbyterian-church-shooting.) It is unclear the extent to which the federal criminal investigation has looked into the suspect’s ties with the Las Vegas ACPU and any role those may have played in the crimes committed or the ties between all ACPUs in the US and the CCP’s China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification. If not, doing so may be key to the prevention of further violence in general and political violence specifically.

[^182]: Yu served as a committee member of the Portland Yee Fung Toy Family Association. He was involved in the founding a new Yee Fung Toy Family Association chapter in Portland and participated in a ceremony to celebrate the opening of its new location in December 2023. (See 波特蘭新聞, “砵崙余風采堂新址正式開幕 眾宗親為族務發展捐款相助,” 5 Jan 2024, https://portlandchinesetimes.com/%E7%A0%B5%E5%B4%99%E4%BD%99%E9%A2%A8%E9%87%87%E5%A0%82%E6%96%B0%E5%9D%80%E6%AD%A3%E5%BC%8F%E9%96%8B%E5%B9%95-%E7%9C%BE%E5%AE%97%E8%A6%AA%.and E7%82%BA%E6%97%8F%E5%8B%99%E7%99%BC%E5%B1%95%E6%8D%90%E6%AC%BE/. See also here for pdf of print version of above article: https://www.pctprintanddesign.com/uploads/5/0/4/6/50460347/109095-a.pdf. ) He participated in a Yee Fung Toy event in Seattle in April 2023. (See photo: http://seattle.yeefungtoy.org/2023_Reports_files/2023.04.23-24.png.) (See ) Yee Fung Toy is a clan association dating back to the late nineteenth century in the US. Like other clan associations, it predates the inception of united front groups in the US. When the CCP began to make a big push to introduce united front influences in the Chinese diaspora, some pre-existing organizations were all but taken over, but clan associations in general are not considered as strongly influenced or controlled by united front forces. In Chinese, the character for Yee is the same as that for Yu—余. The family appears to have originated in southern China and Yee/Yu family associations can be found throughout southeast Asia as well as the US and other countries.
