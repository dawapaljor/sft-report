title: The US Government on Countering Transnational Repression
slug: countering
order: 5
---

All cases of transnational repression documented in this report took place in the United States. Federal authorities in the US have articulated as a priority countering TNR in general and CCP TNR specifically and have taken some measures to do so in practice. This section reviews the US government’s main statements on the matter and actions taken prior to November 2023. After documenting the cases of TNR that occurred in San Francisco, the report will identify governmental shortcomings in preventing and responding to TNR.

The United States has identified countering transnational repression as a national security and human rights priority. Statements to that effect can be found in the National Security Strategy, the Department of Justice’s (DoJ) strategy on countering nation-state threats, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Declaration of Principles to Combat Transnational Repression at the 2023 Summit for Democracy, and other official documents.

### The White House and the Department of State

The US National Security Strategy of 2022 states, “Together with our allies and partners, we are… holding states accountable for violations and abuses of human rights, including… countering transnational repression [emphasis added], and standing with people around the world on the front lines of the fight for dignity, equality and justice.”[^13]

In 2023, one year after the publication of the National Security Strategy, the US was one of eleven countries that endorsed the Declaration of Principles to Combat Transnational Repression at the Summit for Democracy.[^14] It has also reported on CCP TNR in its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices[^15] In January 2024, the US asked about CCP TNR at the PRC’s Universal Periodic Review at the United Nations Human Rights Council.[^16]

In 2022, the Department of State took action against PRC officials involved in TNR.[^17] On three occasions in 2023, the Department of State has issued statements denouncing PRC transnational repression in response to the arrest warrants and bounties of HK$1 million each issued by the Hong Kong national security police against Hong Kongers in exile, some of whom reside in the United States and one of whom is an American citizen.[^18]


### The Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation 
In February 2022, the Assistant Attorney General for National Security at the Department of Justice announced a new Strategy for Countering Nation-State Threats. While naming four states as particularly problematic, the strategy says “the government of China stands apart… The PRC government threatens our security through its concerted use of espionage, theft of trade secrets, malicious cyber activity, transnational repression [emphasis added], and other tactics to advance its interests — all to the detriment of the United States and other democratic nations and their citizens around the world.” [^19]

The FBI’s definition of transnational repression is the following: “When foreign governments stalk, intimidate, or assault people in the United States, it is considered transnational repression.”[^20] 

Much of the DoJ and FBI’s work countering transnational repression focuses on cases perpetrated by individuals acting on behalf of the PRC. From the start of 2020 to January 2024, at least 78 individuals were charged with federal crimes related to CCP TNR for a variety of actions including harassing and threatening Chinese pro-democracy activists, operating an illegal overseas Chinese police station, conducting an online harassment campaign against Chinese dissidents, and attempting to forcibly repatriate a Chinese national living in the US, among others. They have been charged with various crimes such as acting as an agent of a foreign government without providing notification to the US Attorney General, stalking, transmitting interstate threats, committing interstate harassment, obstructing justice, and bribery, among others.[^21]

### Limitations and Challenges
In spite of the US government identifying countering transnational repression as a priority and related law enforcement efforts, a Government Accountability Office report of October 2023 concluded that the US government is failing in its efforts to counter transnational repression. 

Currently, there is no specific law criminalizing TNR. FBI officials say gaps in US law limit the bureau’s ability to counter TNR. At the same time, there is no government-wide definition of TNR established either by agencies or through legislation. 

There is a lack of coordination between federal, state, and local authorities. While federal authorities and officers are aware of TNR as an issue and a concept, local authorities and officers, who are often the first to encounter victims of TNR, are neither trained nor equipped to handle TNR. Thus, cases of TNR are sometimes treated as “ordinary” crimes without identifying the actual or potential involvement of foreign actors, including foreign governments.[^22] (See the “Analysis” and “Recommendations” sections below for further discussion.)

It is clear that countering transnational repression–and TNR carried out by the CCP in particular– is a priority for federal authorities, but they have so far been silent in regard to the harassment, intimidation, and assaults on protesters in San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit.
