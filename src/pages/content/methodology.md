The report is based primarily on the testimonies of twenty-six protesters and one journalist who were present in San Francisco during Xi Jinpingâ€™s visit from November 14 to 17 as well as on video and photographic evidence provided by protesters. Media reports and social media posts have also been of some assistance. 

We have attempted to document all cases of harassment, intimidation and assault on protesters that we came across. All cases described in detail have been substantiated by testimonies of witnesses and actors and/or video and photographic evidence. 

We have attempted to identify those involved in attacks on protesters through the use of facial recognition technology and open-source research.

We have attempted to contact all of those identified in the report as CCP supporters. We have also attempted to contact the San Francisco Police Department. Where we have received responses, we have included those in the report.

The URLs of sources cited in the report were operative as of April 4, 2024. They were also saved at Internet Archive on or before that date.
