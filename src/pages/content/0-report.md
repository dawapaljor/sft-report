This report documents acts of transnational repression (TNR) carried out by supporters of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) against protesters during the visit to San Francisco in November 2023 of Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic of China. In all, 34 cases of harassment, intimidation, and assault are presented. 

The report shows the mobilization and involvement of the CCP’s “united front” network in the United States (US). In many cases, united front groups and figures were present during acts of assault, intimidation, and harassment, and some actively participated in them. The report also documents coordination among CCP supporters that suggests direction and planning. Their actions created a pervasive atmosphere of intimidation that not only had a deterrent effect on protests throughout the duration of Xi’s stay but also interfered with protesters’ exercise of their free speech rights.

Most of the victims of the attacks were American citizens and residents, and all but one of the victims of the attacks had roots in China, East Turkestan, Hong Kong or Tibet. All were targets of TNR in San Francisco for demonstrating their opposition to Xi and the CCP. Some had previously been targets of repression in their homelands, or targets of CCP TNR, or both. 

The report also examines the response mechanisms of US policymakers and law enforcement authorities at both federal and local levels. Despite strong awareness of CCP TNR at the federal level and a general commitment to countering it, agencies were unprepared to do so in San Francisco. Local law enforcement authorities exhibited a lack of awareness of TNR, were often unresponsive when alerted to the attacks, and took little and inadequate action in response to the attacks. The result was that protesters were insufficiently protected and perpetrators have not been held accountable.

This report makes 18 recommendations to the White House, relevant federal agencies, Congress, state and local authorities, and the United Nations, and includes  the following recommendations: 

- Investigate whether united front groups in the US are acting as unregistered foreign agents of the PRC in violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
- Implement additional vetting for diplomatic visas issued to PRC applicants and screening for applicants connected to TNR activities.
- Offer protection to groups on US soil that are subject to TNR, including by expediting asylum cases and upgrading the existing Deferred Enforced Departure program for Hong Kongers to a Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation.
- Pass legislation creating resources to combat TNR, such as the Transnational Repression Policy Act (H.R. 3654/S.831), the Stop Transnational Repression Act (H.R. 5907), the Combating Transnational Repression Act of 2024 (H.R. 7443), the Law Enforcement Support and Transnational Repression Hotline Act (H.R. 7433), and the Strengthening State and Local Efforts to Combat Transnational Repression Act (H.R. 7439).
- Maintain relations with a diversity of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) groups representing different political views and identities and conduct due diligence on these groups’ backgrounds.

<h2  id="methodology" class="text-4xl font-extrabold py-10 underline decoration-amber-300 underline-offset-8 decoration-8 ">Methodology</h2>


This report is based primarily on the testimonies of 26 protesters and one journalist who were present in San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit from November 14 to 17, 2023, as well as on video and photographic evidence provided by protesters. Media reports and social media posts have also been of some assistance. 

We have attempted to document all cases of harassment and intimidation of and assault on protesters that we came across. All cases described in detail have been substantiated by testimonies of participants and witnesses and/or video and photographic evidence. 

We have attempted to identify those involved in attacks on protesters through the use of open-source research and facial recognition technology. 

We have identified some groups and individuals as belonging to the Chinese Communist Party’s “united front,” meaning that evidence was found indicating that they have associated with Party organs and/or officials and/or representatives of the People’s Republic of China, and have taken actions aligned with the Party’s agenda. In most cases that evidence was found in reporting by Chinese-language media and on websites of Party organs or united front groups.

We have attempted to contact all of those identified in the report as CCP supporters as well as private security firms perceived to be associated with CCP supporters through email, telephone calls and letters. We notified them that they are mentioned in the report, asked if we might ask them some questions, and offered them the opportunity to respond and comment. As of May 15, 2024, most have not responded. None has responded affirmatively. In many cases, these groups and individuals have little to no online presence or website. Many of the email addresses and phone numbers they have made available online or in tax documents proved to be incorrect, out of date, or inoperative. In the first instance, we contacted them by telephone or email at the numbers and addresses that could be found. Where that did not succeed, and in cases where post addresses could be found, we sent letters to them. Only two could be reached by phone. Both made clear they did not wish to speak with us. One responded to email inquiries. None responded to letters.Of those identified in the report as being present on the streets of San Francisco during Xi’s visit, we have not been able to find contact information for three leaders of united front groups, one CCP member based in the PRC, and one convicted felon with no known united front leadership position.

We have also reached out to the San Francisco Police Department, the South San Francisco Police Department, and the San Mateo Sheriff’s Office for information and comment.. 

Where we have received responses, we have included those in the report.

<h2  id="intro" class="text-4xl font-extrabold py-10 underline decoration-amber-300 underline-offset-8 decoration-8 ">Introduction</h2>

In November 2023, Xi Jinping, President of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), came to San Francisco to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit and meet United States (US) President Joe Biden. During Xi’s stay in the city from November 14 to 17, hundreds of Chinese, Hong Kongers, Tibetans, and Uyghurs demonstrated against Xi and the CCP’s harsh crackdown in their homelands.<sup>[^1]</sup> Dozens of protesters were harassed, intimidated, and assaulted. These attacks were carried out by CCP supporters or those acting on their behalf in what appeared to be an organized and coordinated manner. Leaders of united front groups in the US that have been linked to the CCP were involved in the attacks. The attacks constitute transnational repression (TNR) as they targeted opponents of the CCP in the US. Although the US government has identified countering TNR as a top priority, awareness and preparation on the part of law enforcement authorities in San Francisco appeared inadequate.<sup>[^2]</sup> 

This report describes the attacks on protesters in detail and  is based primarily on interviews and testimonies of 26 protesters and one journalist, most of whom were victims of harassment, intimidation, and assault, as well as on photographic and video evidence. It highlights the attacks as a serious instance of transnational repression. It also identifies united front figures involved in the attacks. The report calls on the US government as well as local governments and law enforcement authorities at both the federal and local levels to identify shortcomings and improve efforts to: 

1. prevent and counter transnational repression; 
1. protect the rights of protesters and human rights defenders; and 
1. hold perpetrators of transnational repression accountable.

The protesters were from different backgrounds. Most have their origins in China, East Turkestan, Hong Kong, and Tibet. Many are American citizens, and almost all reside in the US. This is a story that needs to be told because it is part of the history of these peoples—Chinese, Hong Kongers, Tibetans, Uyghurs—fighting for their freedom and their human rights, but it also needs to be told to assist authorities in the US and other countries to more effectively counter CCP transnational repression on their own soil.

At the center of the report is a detailed, chronological narrative of the attacks perpetrated by CCP supporters on protesters while Xi Jinping visited San Francisco. Preceding that are brief sections on the CCP and its overseas united front and on the US government’s prioritization of countering TNR in general and CCP TNR specifically. Following the chronological narrative are sections on responses and reactions to the attacks in San Francisco, analysis, and recommendations.


<h2  id="overseasunitedfront" class="text-4xl font-extrabold py-10 underline decoration-amber-300 underline-offset-8 decoration-8 ">The CCP and Its Overseas United Front</h2>


In order to understand the transnational repression that took place in San Francisco, it is important to understand the network of organizations that enabled the repression and appeared to coordinate in organizing it.

The CCP puts enormous effort and resources into exerting influence and control over what it considers to be Chinese diaspora communities around the world, including not just Chinese immigrants and their families but also Hong Kongers, Taiwanese, Tibetans, and Uyghurs living abroad.

These efforts to control diaspora communities are closely tied to the CCP concept of the “united front” (統一戰線), the idea that the cultivation of support of and loyalty to the Party at home and abroad is central to maintaining the CCP’s power. To that end, the CCP employs both a set of directly-controlled party organs and a larger number of loosely linked overseas groups to carry out its united front strategy. In practice, the term “united front work” (統戰工作) is used rather elastically and can refer to activities carried out by both official agencies and informally associated overseas groups.<sup>[^3]</sup>

**United Front: Main Organs and Overseas Affiliates**

Though these types of organizations are often grouped together as part of a loosely-defined “CCP United Front,” this report takes care to differentiate between the two:

Specifically, this report uses the term “United Front” (capitalized) to denote organizations which are constituent parts of the Chinese Communist Party, fully folded into Party infrastructure and directly controlled and operated by CCP authorities. On the other hand, this report uses the term “united front groups” (lowercase letters) to describe overseas groups which may not necessarily have formal ties with the CCP and its United Front agencies, but are often used to carry out the CCP’s agenda. 

The United Front Work Department (中共中央統一戰線工作部/UFWD) is the CCP organ formally in charge of the CCP’s united front strategy. Its work is supplemented by that of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese (中華全國歸國華僑聯合會/ACFROC), a key United Front organization that, in 2018, was designated by the CCP as the main organ responsible for relations with overseas Chinese.<sup>[^4]</sup> ACFROC maintains provincial and municipal offices within the PRC that help maintain relations with Chinese expatriates from these localities. This report documents several connections between members of united front groups and local ACFROC offices.

PRC embassies and consulates also play a key role in cultivating united front groups overseas, often providing them with guidance and direction at key junctures. This report documents many instances in which key figures in united front groups met with or participated in events together with high-ranking PRC consulate officials. 

Typically, CCP officials overseeing united front groups prefer that they preserve a facade of autonomy from CCP United Front organs like the UFWD and ACFROC, as well as from PRC consulates. As noted by Anne-Marie Brady, an academic and expert on the overseas United Front, the CCP “wants to avoid being seen to ‘lead’ [領導] the overseas Chinese community, but rather prefers to be seen to ‘guide’ [引導] them.”<sup>[^5]</sup>

In actuality, however, united front groups rarely if ever deviate from the CCP’s official stance on any matter. Generally speaking, CCP United Front officials strive to create a situation where overseas united front groups will know the Party’s will and do the Party’s bidding without requiring official direction or supervision. Brady notes that “[t]he goal of successful overseas Chinese work is to get the community to proactively and even better, spontaneously, engage in activities which enhance China’s foreign policy agenda.”<sup>[^6]</sup>

Because of this strategy, civic organizations in diaspora communities may have united front links. United front groups may take the form of hometown associations, business associations, Chinese Students and Scholars Association chapters at foreign universities, or associations for the so-called “peaceful reunification of China” (the CCP’s preferred term for its efforts to bring Taiwan under CCP rule). Groups of this nature tend to display strong signs of united front links, and often have members who maintain close communication with CCP United Front organs and appear at public events with PRC officials.

These groups also often seek to cultivate relations with politicians and officials—especially local politicians and officials—in the countries in which they operate, claiming to broadly represent the political views and concerns of the “Chinese community” or even the “Asian community,” crowding out a far more diverse representation of voices, especially those with views different from the CCP’s. In the US, local politicians and officials often meet these united front groups without appearing to be aware of their links to the CCP. While there is no official public list of united front organizations, organizations that exhibit many of the characteristics mentioned above appear frequently in this report as they and their leaders were present on the streets of San Francisco during Xi Jinping’s visit. 

Additionally, many Chinese-language media outlets which are widely read in diaspora communities are nowadays controlled or influenced to one extent or another by the CCP or by businesses and interests loyal to the CCP.<sup>[^7]</sup> As such, they too may be considered part of a broader united front strategy. Much of the information about united front groups found in this report comes from pro-CCP Chinese-language diaspora media.



> According to articles in Chinese-language pro-CCP publications, based on information provided by an official at the United Front Work Department of Guilin city, Chen came from Guilin in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the PRC  to the US in the 1980s to study, later settling there. As of September 2023, he was president of the Guilin Qiaozi Enterprise Federation (桂林僑資企業聯合會), board chair of the Guangxi Tourism Development Group (廣西景區通旅遊發展有限公司), and an overseas committee member of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese (中國僑聯/中華全國歸國華僑聯合會/AFROC). AFROC is the same organization to which Lu Qiang (see above) belongs, the top-level United Front group with overall responsibility for overseeing relations with overseas Chinese.<sup>[^79]</sup> In fact, Chen attended the same event as Lu, the 11th National Congress of Returned Overseas Chinese, in September 2023 in Beijing, just two months before Xi Jinping’s trip to San Francisco. Xi Jinping and other top CCP officials addressed this Congress, and Chen posed for a photo in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.<sup>[^80]</sup>

Another man who appears prominent and centrally in the video in which Li Huanjun is harassed and intimidated is also a united front leader.
